    "Documents in LlamaIndex may be different from your traditional perception of documents. <br>\n",
    "Document and Node objects are core abstractions within LlamaIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Document** is a generic container around any data source - for instance, a PDF, an API output, or retrieved data from a database. They can be constructed manually, or created automatically via data loaders. By default, a Document stores text along with some other attributes. Some of these are\n",
    "\n",
    "`metadata` - a dictionary of annotations that can be appended to the text (basically, additional info about the document) <br>\n",
    "`relationships` - a dictionary containing relationships to other Documents/Nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Node** represents a \"chunk\" of a source Document, whether that is a text chunk, an image, or other. Similar to Documents, they contain metadata and relationship information with other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are a first-class citizen in LlamaIndex. You can choose to define Nodes and all its attributes directly. You may also choose to \"parse\" source Documents into Nodes through our `NodeParser` classes. By default every Node derived from a Document will inherit the same metadata from that Document (e.g. a \"file_name\" filed in the Document is propagated to every Node).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Documents and Nodes have unique identifies called `ID`. These can be set automatically or manually. `ID` is generally used to identify, update, and define relationships between documents (or nodes).\n",

We support the goals of the Paris Agreement and a transition to a net-zero carbon economy. By 2050, our goal is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, including our financed emissions. \\nWells Fargo’s Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report outlines our strategic \\napproach to managing the risks associated with climate change and deploying capital to support a transition to a low-carbon economy. We firmly believe that addressing climate-related risks also presents opportunities for innovation, growth, and long-term value creation. \\nAt Wells Fargo, we're focusing on the following areas: • Supporting clients' transition to a low-carbon economy, including the deployment of $500 billion in \\nsustainable finance by 2030. \\n• Increasing transparency and accountability by disclosing emissions and setting reduction targets for high-emitting sectors. \\n• Reducing Wells Fargo's own operational emissions. \\n• Integrating climate considerations into our Risk Management Framework and decision-making. \\n• Leveraging the Wells Fargo Institute for Sustainable Finance to support clients and communities to accelerate the transition to an equitable, low-carbon economy. \\nWe know we cannot do this alone. The path to net-zero emissions is complex and will require action from governments, businesses, communities, and individuals; it will also require policy measures, technological advancements, and behavioral changes. \\nI hope you enjoy reading about our approach and some of the climate-related initiatives underway across Wells \\nFargo in the pages that follow. \\nCharlie Scharf \\nChief Executive Officer Wells Fargo & Company \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

At the same \\ntime, we are developing climate expertise in existing teams and using formal management steering committees and other forums to support specific initiatives and facilitate cross-functional efforts in a flexible way. In our view, this combined approach best balances the need for disciplined management governance and Board oversight, while enhancing our ability to adjust quickly to changing risks and opportunities. \\nAt its core, our approach underscores our view that the assessment, management, and oversight of climate-\\nrelated risks and opportunities should be integrated into the business of the Company. We view climate change as one of many drivers of the types of risk we already manage, with effects manifesting both in financial risk (credit, interest rate, market, and liquidity) and nonfinancial risk (strategic, reputational, and operational, which includes compliance and model risk). Climate-related opportunities are also important for us to understand. The transition to a lower-carbon economy creates new business models, new opportunities to finance customer transitions, and new industries requiring banking support. With these considerations factored into our governance approach, climate-related risks influence go-forward business planning, our risk and control infrastructure, and areas where topic-specific expertise is most needed.

In 2020, they launched the Vision Investing initiative that provides opportunities for clients to align their personal values with their investment portfolios. \\nDeploying sustainable finance \\nA key way we leverage our internal expertise and capacity is by directly financing activities that are designed to address climate change. This requires making significant changes to the way society produces and uses energy. Additionally, it requires changes to the built environment, which encompasses the buildings that are lived and worked in, the systems that provide water and electricity, and the infrastructure that supports transportation. Many of these activities involve manufacturing, installing, replacing, or updating large capital assets that have high upfront costs for companies and households. Whether it is families purchasing electric vehicles or \\nmanufacturers increasing the efficiency of their operations, upfront cost may be a barrier to adoption. \\nThis is why financing is such a critical component to how the world will address climate change. And in turn, this \\nis why we view this opportunity as a significant area for business growth. We seek to leverage our broad existing set of financing solutions to support sustainable activities. We also offer a range of sustainable finance-focused solutions including green, social, and sustainability bond underwriting, sustainability-linked capital, Wealth & Investment Management portfolios, project or asset-specific financing, and more.

In May 2022, we disclosed our first interim targets for reducing GHG emissions attributable to financing activities in the Oil & Gas and Power sectors. The 2030 targets announced in 2022 for these sectors, based on a 2019 baseline, are: \\n• Oil & Gas sector: 72.3 MTCO2e, a 26% reduction in absolute emissions \\n• Power sector: 102 kgCO2e/MWh, a 63% reduction in portfolio emissions intensity\\n10 \\nThese targets are detailed in CO2eMission , our methodology for aligning financial portfolios to the 1.5 °Celsius \\ngoal of the Paris Agreement and for setting interim, emissions-based targets to guide that alignment. The \\nCO2eMission publication is available on our website. This methodology not only helps us set targets but also allows for comparison of the pace of transition within given portfolios, enabling the work to adapt and evolve over time. \\nWhen setting these initial targets and publishing the CO2eMission methodology, we committed to developing \\nhigh-level transition plans that outline categories of action we expect to take to meet the 2030 targets for the Oil & Gas and Power sectors. Accordingly, we are now developing a transition framework and will continue to monitor evolving regulatory requirements and market practices concerning their public disclosure. \\nOur independent work on these efforts is proceeding in general alignment with Net-Zero Banking Alliance \\nguidelines and practical guidance from groups like the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. \\n10 See Progress toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets in the Metrics and targets section for additional information on the percent reduction in the Power portfolio’s emissions intensity.

Risk is the possibility of an event occurring that could adversely affect our ability to achieve strategic or business objectives. We routinely take risks, within our risk appetite and approved exceptions, to achieve our business goals and serve our customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and nonfinancial risks, such as operational risk (which includes compliance and model risks), and strategic and reputation risks. Every employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining our control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nSenior management sets the tone at the top by supporting a strong culture, defined by Wells Fargo’s \\nexpectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to our customers, communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. Wells Fargo’s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations. \\nThe Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the Front Line, Independent Risk Management and \\nInternal Audit. Each line of defense has distinct risk management responsibilities. \\n• Front Line: The Front Line, which comprises our principal lines of business and certain enterprise function \\nactivities, is the first line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its business activities. \\n• Independent Risk Management: Independent Risk Management is the second line of defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk management program and provides oversight of, including challenge to and independent assessment and monitoring, the Front Line’s execution of its risk management responsibilities. \\n• Internal Audit: Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is responsible for acting as an independent assurance function and validates that the risk management program is adequately designed and functioning effectively.

A physical emissions intensity metric is expressed as a ratio of absolute emissions over a unit of output (for example, kilograms of CO2e per megawatt-hour). The choice between the metrics for target setting is determined based on assessment of the activities driving emissions in a given sector. \\nAs noted in the preceding table, we selected an absolute emissions metric for our Oil & Gas portfolio target. An \\nabsolute metric is well-suited not only to measure reductions in our Oil & Gas clients’ operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2), but also to capture reductions in Scope 3, category 11 (use of sold products) emissions resulting from clients transitioning into new businesses. For this metric, we measure client emissions attributable to our financing using an attribution factor that reflects our financing to each client relative to client value.\\n26 \\n25 See “Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks, ” (https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UNEP-FI-Guidelines-for-Climate-Change-Target-Setting. pdf) on p.6, U.N.

Commitments in the numerator are composed of both \\nfunded and unfunded components, while client value in the denominator represents on-balance sheet funding only. By adding unfunded commitments to client value, Wells Fargo reduces the over-allocation of emissions that would arise from an unadjusted approach. Note that a complete approach would entail the addition of all unfunded commitments from all lenders, but given data availability, we add only the unfunded portion of our commitment. Although this method risks overallocating emissions to Wells Fargo, we concluded that this approach would best align with the client relationship-based principles of CO2eMission.

We also consider sector-specific, asset-level data sets collated by third-party data providers, which quantify emissions from individual physical assets (for example, power plants or oil and gas wells) within a sector, attributing the associated emissions to the parent companies that own these facilities. Though existing data-scoring methods provide universal guidance — often favoring company-reported emissions over asset-level data, we found that the quality of reported data varied significantly by sector. Accordingly, rather than taking a “one-size-fits-all” approach to data sources preferring company-reported data to asset-level data (or vice versa), we evaluate the quality of data sources on a sector-by-sector basis.\\n28 \\n28 To learn more about evaluating data quality for emission-based target setting, see “Data Quality Considerations for Estimating Financed Emissions, ” (https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-01/Data-Quality-\\nConsiderations-for-Estimating-Financed-Emissions. pdf) K.

In \\naddition to our target-setting activities, we are also preparing an emissions profile or “footprint” of our lending portfolios for the sectors for which we have set targets. We anticipate our initial approach to footprinting will be broadly consistent with the sectoral boundaries we employ for target setting. The absolute emissions footprint metrics we produce will complement the emissions intensity metric we use for our Power, Automotive, Aviation, and Steel portfolio targets and the separate absolute emissions-based metric we use for our Oil & Gas portfolio target.\\n29 Our approach to financed emissions footprinting will likely evolve over time in \\nresponse to industry trends, data availability, and regulatory requirements. \\nProgress toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets \\nTo provide some context for our progress toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets, we begin by briefly describing the targets, key methodological choices for the targets, and a change to our 2019 Power baseline measurement. \\nBackground \\nOur Oil & Gas portfolio target is an absolute emissions target that covers emissions from companies engaged in exploration and production activities (Scope 1, 2, and 3, category 11 (use of sold products)) and emissions from companies engaged in petroleum refining (Scope 1 and 2). Our Power portfolio target is an emissions intensity target that covers emissions from power-generating activities (Scope 1). The targets cover both lending and capital markets facilitation activities (and dedicated renewable energy financing for the Power sector) and are aligned to the NGFS Orderly Net Zero 2050 scenario released in June 2021. For more information on the Oil & Gas and Power targets, please see sections 3 and 4 in CO2eMission (PDF) . \\n29 The absolute emissions-based metric we use for our Oil & Gas target fixes client value as of certain dates to limit volatility. For a detailed description of how we calculate this metric, please see our CO2eMission document . Commonly used \\nmethodologies for developing emissions footprints, by contrast, typically apply a client value that corresponds to the year that a given footprint is intended to represent. We take the extra measure of fixing client value in our target metric, since year-over-year changes in client value can materially affect the emissions attributable to bank financing without any changes in underlying client emissions.

We \\nsubsequently received 2019 power-generation data and recalculated our 2019 baseline. Using the 2019 data, the baseline emissions intensity changed from 253 kg CO2e/MWh to 273 kg CO2e/MWh. This change in the baseline emissions intensity was expected and, in part, is further evidence of the ongoing transition that is currently occurring in the Power sector. Nonetheless, our target, which converges with the NGFS Orderly Net Zero 2050 scenario benchmark in 2030, remains unchanged. However, with the change in the 2019 baseline, the percent reduction in the portfolio’s emissions intensity to achieve the target has now increased from a 60% reduction to a 63% reduction. \\nProgress through December 31, 2021 \\nThe following table shows the progress made toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets from the 2019 baseline year through December 31, 2021.\\n30 \\nSector Metric 12/31/19 Baseline 12/31/21 Progress 2030 Target \\nOil & Gas Absolute emissions 97.7 81.1 72.3 \\n• Exploration and production (Scope 1, 2, and 3, category 11 (million metric tons of CO2e) MT CO2e MT CO2e MT CO2e \\n17% reduction from 26% reduction from \\n(use of sold products)) 2019 baseline 2019 baseline \\n• Refining (Scope 1 and 2) \\nPower \\n• Power generation (Scope 1) Emissions intensity 273 215 102 \\n(kilograms CO2e/ kg CO2e/MWh kg CO2e/MWh kg CO2e/MWh \\nmegawatt-hour) 21% reduction from 63% reduction from \\n2019 baseline 2019 baseline \\nAs shown in the previous table, the attributable emissions of our Oil & Gas portfolio decreased from a 2019 \\nbaseline of 97.7 MT CO2e to 81.1 MT CO2e (17% reduction). This decrease was driven mainly by three factors. Most of the decrease was driven by business-as-usual turnover in clients, including the impact of industry consolidation and restructuring activity from the COVID-19 downturn. Additional decreases were the result of reductions in borrowing bases for reserve-based lending facilities that took place during the 2019-2021 time \\n30 We source Company emissions data from S&P Trucost and GlobalData. S&P Trucost provides reported emissions data, which comes from a variety of sources. GlobalData provides production data, which we use to impute a client’s \\nemissions. For Oil & Gas, this production data is a combination of reported data and vendor estimated data (when reported data is not available). For Power generation, the production data is estimated from capacity and plant load (that is, utilization by fuel type) factor. Because S&P Trucost and GlobalData refresh this data frequently, the emissions data (as well as the percentage of reported versus estimated data) may vary depending on the date the data is extracted. For this progress report, S&P Trucost and GlobalData emissions data for 2021 was extracted on June 24, 2022, and July 6, 2022, respectively.

The reductions in borrowing \\nbases reduced our commitments and, consequently, the share of client emissions attributable to our financing. A minor part of this decrease was due to a reduction in client emissions, primarily as a result of production decreases and associated operational changes in 2020 in response to COVID-driven demand declines. \\nThe emissions intensity of our Power portfolio decreased from a 2019 baseline of 273 kg CO2e/MWh to 215 \\nkg CO2e/MWh (21% reduction) due primarily to an increase in our dedicated renewable energy financings, which have lower emissions intensities compared to our general purpose lending and capital markets facilitation activities. Additionally, our weighted average Power portfolio intensity also benefited from a modest reduction in average intensity across our nonrenewable portfolio due to clients generating more electricity from low- and zero-emission sources, such as wind and solar, and reducing reliance on higher-emitting sources. \\nPotential impacts to future progress \\nLooking ahead, we anticipate that progress toward our Oil & Gas and Power targets may not follow a straight line because realizing the assumptions supporting our targets depends upon several factors, many of which are outside our control. For example, the emissions intensity of our Power portfolio may increase if Power utilities continue the recent trend of selling their renewable energy assets and then purchasing electricity generated from these assets through power purchase agreements. As noted in CO2eMission , our methodology’s \\nintensity metric does not account for emission reductions attributable to power purchase agreements because clients do not uniformly disclose information associated with these agreements. If utilities shift from generating renewable energy through assets they own to selling these assets and purchasing the electricity they produce through power purchase agreements, our portfolio emissions intensity may increase without any change to emissions in the real economy. \\nMoreover, progress toward targets may be obscured by the lag between the time a client raises capital to \\nsupport its climate transition and the time it takes that client to invest in its own transformation. If a bank provides capital to a Power utility that is planning to develop a wind farm, for example, the client emissions intensity attributable to the bank will not reflect that wind farm until it is generating power — a process that can take months to years.

Additionally, progress toward our Oil & Gas target may be impacted by volatility in Oil & Gas commodity prices. These fluctuations may materially impact one or more inputs used to calculate client emissions attributable to our financing, and by extension, materially impact our target progress. \\nFor example, as Oil & Gas commodity prices increase, client value (that is, enterprise value and/or book value of \\ndebt and equity) may increase as it tends to be highly correlated with commodity prices. Given our approach for attributing client emissions to our financing activities,\\n31 an increase in client value may result in a decrease \\nin our financed emissions calculation, even if client emissions stayed the same or even increased. The opposite is also true; a decrease in client value may result in an increase in our financed emissions calculation, even if we did not increase our financing to the client .\\n32 \\nSimilar fluctuations may also be seen in reserve-based loans, where the size of the facility varies with underlying commodity prices. As Oil & Gas commodity prices increase, for example, the value of the Oil & Gas reserves that comprise the collateral for the loans would likely increase, which then increases the underlying borrowing base that governs the facility. This, in turn, drives a corresponding increase in our outstanding commitments to that client and consequently, an increase of our financed emissions calculation. \\nThough our target-setting methodology includes features designed to mitigate some of the \\nvolatility noted above (see section 2 of CO2eMission (PDF) ), we cannot control all factors that impact \\nthe assumptions supporting the targets. There remain numerous variables and assumptions embedded in our calculations that will drive volatility in our progress and may affect the accuracy in our reported results as noted herein and in CO2eMission. \\n31 As noted above and explained in CO2eMission , we attribute our Oil & Gas clients’ Scope 3 emissions to our financing using a balance sheet approach. Under this approach, the attribution factor reflects our financing to a client relative to \\nthe client’s value (Wells Fargo financing/client value). To measure client value, we use enterprise value including cash if the client is a publicly-traded company or the book value of debt plus equity if the client is a privately-held company.\\n32 For more information on how fluctuations in client value impact client emissions attributable to a financial institution, see, e.g., Jakob Thomä, Stan Dupré, and Michael Hayne. 2018. “A Taxonomy of Accounting Principles for Financial \\nPortfolios,” (https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/328 ) Sustainability 10, No. 2: 328, accessed March 14, 2023.

Recognizing that each industry or sector of the real economy is unique, we have taken the approach of grouping our financial portfolios by industry and setting industry-specific targets, rather than a Companywide target, for our financial portfolios. This sector-based approach allows us to set targets informed by the trends and challenges each industry is facing. \\nTo set a sector-specific target, we consider a host of design choices. Our methodology endeavors to apply certain design \\nchoices universally across all sectors. For example, the decision to include both the financing we provide clients through lending activities and the financing we facilitate through debt and equity capital markets activities applies to all sectors. Other design choices, such as which metric or climate scenario to use for a target and which activities and emissions scopes to include, are made on a sector-specific basis. \\nOur methodology includes several key design features that distinguish it from other target-setting methodologies and \\nframeworks: \\n• The methodology uses committed exposure (credit available to a client) rather than outstanding exposure (funds drawn \\nfrom the available credit by a client) in attributing client emissions to the Company’s financing activities. Using committed exposure provides a more complete measurement of the funding we have agreed to provide to a client. \\n• The methodology measures client emissions attributable to our lending activities, as well as the capital markets activities we help facilitate. Although the NZBA and supporting industry frameworks and tools do not currently include funding arranged in the capital markets, we include it in our methodology to capture more fully financing activities in each sector. (We also include renewable tax equity financing for our Power target.) \\n• Our methodology amortizes capital markets facilitation activities over a five-year period to minimize potential volatility inherent in these activities. It also fixes client value as of certain dates to limit volatility due to changes in value for Oil & \\nGas clients\\n. \\n• To quantify clients’ emissions, we evaluate and prioritize available data sources on a sector-by-sector basis. In so doing, we \\nconsider the appropriateness of relying upon company-reported emissions versus asset-level production data collated by third-party data providers. Though existing data scoring methods often favor company-reported emissions over asset-level production data, the quality of company-reported emissions can vary across and within sectors. We are working with the Spatial Finance Initiative at the University of Oxford to empirically evaluate data quality on a sector-by-sector basis with a view to providing sector-specific data scoring guidance. \\nWe anticipate our methodology will evolve over time as approaches to net-zero mature, emissions data improves, and climate scenarios evolve. Moving forward, we intend to continue to address challenges and refine our approach. For more information, please see CO2eMission on our website.

The goal mobilizes and focuses internal resources to help meet customers where they are on this critical journey. We also recognize the significant business opportunities that lie ahead by serving client and customer demand for sustainability-focused financing solutions. In 2022, we continued to leverage our broad set of products, solutions, and capabilities across all lines of business to drive financing toward sustainable activities. \\nWe define sustainability to include both environmental and social objectives. Our internal Sustainable Finance \\nEligibility Criteria (“the criteria”), updated this year in our Sustainability & Governance Report (PDF)  Appendix\\n33, \\nprovides a list of the various category descriptions and eligible activities for our $500 billion sustainable finance goal. Our criteria evolve as industry best practices change and mature and are designed to capture transactions where the funds are used for qualifying sustainable activities or to encourage qualifying sustainable activities. These choices align with the Company’s continued focus on delivering benefits to our clients, customers, and communities. For our progress toward our $500 billion goal, we obtained limited assurance on our assertion of \\nthe total amount of sustainable finance activities originated, committed, advised, or facilitated that meet the criteria\\n34. \\nThe table below reports our cumulative progress toward the 2030 goal through 2022. Total sustainable finance is broken down into the categories of environmental finance, social finance, and standard-aligned sustainable finance\\n35. \\nStandard-aligned sustainable finance \\nA significant portion of Wells Fargo’s qualifying sustainable finance activity is through “standard-aligned” transactions. These are financial products either directly dedicated to or linked to environmental and/or social outcomes that aim to align with recognized voluntary market standards or principles. This includes instruments like green, social, sustainability, and sustainability-linked bonds as well as green, social, and sustainability-linked loans. See the Sustainable Finance Eligibility Criteria in the Appendix of our Sustainability & Governance Report (PDF) for more details. \\n33 Our Sustainable Finance Eligibility Criteria was updated for calendar year 2022 related to Green Buildings (inclusion of additional green building certification schemes), Housing Affordability (inclusion of financing that meets government \\nand government-sponsored enterprise definitions of affordable housing), and Standard-aligned Sustainable Finance (inclusion of transactions not captured by Dealogic or Bloomberg and reviewed internally).

We proudly serve more than 80 million households in the U.S, more than 5. 7 million small businesses and hundr\\neds of thousands \\nof companies in critical economic sectors. We do not make decisions based on political or social agendas.   We manage risk.\\nManaging risk is critical to the long-term success of our \\nbusiness and r\\nequired by our regulators.  We make risk-based \\nassessments, including legal, credit, market, reputational and regulatory, to drive decisions and advance the interests of our constituencies. \\nWe want to compete.\\nOur ability to compete, in both established and new markets, \\nis critical to the lon\\ng-term success of our business. We decide \\nwhere and how we choose to compete by assessing risk and opportunity, not to further political or social agendas.We believe in free enterprise. \\nMarkets and economies of all sizes benefit when free and \\nfair en\\nterprise thrives — creating innovation, competition \\nand maximizing value for shareholders, clients, customers and communities. Government intervention of free market principles, for political reasons in the short-term, sets a dangerous precedent that’s hard to reverse.

A NOTE ON OUR TARGETS\\nWe consistently set targets to play our part in creating a sustainable future using our own independent assessment of what we determine is reasonable and achievable, and will serve the best interest of our business and serving our clients. While we pursue these targets, we note that they are subject to other prerequisites and critical considerations, both within and outside our control. These include the necessity of technological advancements, the evolution of consumer behavior and demand, the need for thoughtful climate polices, the potential impact of legal and regulatory obligations and the challenge of balancing short-term targets with the need to facilitate an orderly transition and energy security.\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A key challenge is meeting governments and companies’ net-zero emissions goals by 2050 while also meeting the global need for secure, reliable and affordable energy. As I have said before, these objectives are not mutually exclusive. We can — and must — do both. \\nAs a global financial institution, we have an important role to play: providing our clients with the advice and capital they need to advance their decarbonization strategies and drawing on our expertise to help address broader challenges in the low-carbon transition. We believe that a successful transition generates economic growth, preserves energy security and affordability, and mitigates the worst impacts of climate change. In order to successfully achieve that transition, a massive ramp up — to the tune of $4 trillion dollars of annual investment — will be needed, bringing with it the potential to generate a wave of growth and opportunity the world hasn’t seen since the First Industrial Revolution.  \\nFrom where we stand today, there are numerous barriers to deeper decarbonization across the global economy. While capital allocation and investments are crucial, these tools alone cannot overcome the challenges. To develop and scale climate solutions, the world needs thoughtful, well-implemented public policy that incentivizes low-carbon investments; research and development to support swift technological advancements; financially viable clean energy investments; resilient supply chains; and a strong, skilled workforce. As we continue to navigate the complex challenges posed by climate change, the world must work together. We will continue to play our role, supporting today’s energy needs and helping our clients through their decarbonization journeys — all while creating long-term shareholder value. Introduction\\nJamie Dimon\\nChairman & CEO, JPMorgan\\xa0Chase & Co.Message from Our Chairman & CEO\\nWe cannot, however, get there without unprecedented action from governments, states, regulators, policymakers, thought leaders and all corners of the private sector. \\nThis Climate Report provides a platform to communicate our progress toward our climate targets. In pursuing the global goal of a transition to a low-carbon economy, we always operate independently and use our own judgment based on the best interest of the Firm and serving our clients and will continue to do so. Since our 2022 report, we have expanded our efforts and focus, including:\\n• Establishing two new sectoral targets for Shipping and Aluminum;\\n• Updating and adapting our emissions intensity reduction targets to align with the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; and\\n• Calculating absolute financed emissions for eight sectors of our financing portfolio.\\nIn addition, we have expanded the focus of our “Oil & Gas End Use” target, which is now the “Energy Mix” target. This update shows — among other things — how our financing correlates with the emissions performance of the energy supply sector. We expect this updated target will not only reflect market actions that are needed to support the transition from fossil fuels to low- or zero-carbon alternatives but will also provide a more holistic representation of decarbonization efforts.\\n1\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Oversight of ESG matters, including those related to environmental sustainability and climate, is an important part of the Board’s work. In 2022, some of the topics discussed during Board and Committee meetings included climate risk, climate and ESG disclosure, and laws and regulations regarding access to financial services.\\nIn addition, the five standing committees: Public Responsibility Committee, Compensation & Management Development Committee, Risk Committee, Audit Committee and Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee, operate pursuant to written charters and oversee ESG-related matters within their scope of responsibility. These charters can be accessed on our \\nwebsite . Our annual Proxy Statement  includes \\nadditional information about the membership and responsibilities of each committee.\\nClimate- and ESG-related matters continue to be considered as part of our director education program. In 2022, directors participated in programs on a number of subjects, including sustainability updates, the Firm’s climate risk management framework and ESG-related disclosure.Senior Management\\nOur management structure is designed to encourage leadership that is consistent with our corporate standards. With respect to climate-related matters, senior management’s responsibilities include: consideration of climate-related risks in the Firm’s strategy and operations, as well as the implementation of strategic climate-related business initiatives.\\nOur Firm’s most senior management body is the Operating Committee (“OC”), which is composed of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General Counsel, CEOs of each of the LOBs and other senior executives. The OC and Board of Directors receive updates from the CRO, the Global Head of Sustainability, the Global Head of the Corporate Advisory and Sustainable Solutions (“CASS”), LOB CEOs and other senior leaders on climate-related initiatives, as appropriate. For more information on CASS, see page 9 in the Strategy section of the report.\\nUtilizing the Firm’s emerging expertise on environmental topics, various climate related initiatives across LOBs are periodically managed through business reviews to encourage ongoing transition efforts. The Firmwide Environmental Committee (“FEC”) — established in 2022 — reviews progress on environmental and climate initiatives and targets. Co-chaired by the CRO and the Global Head of Sustainability, the FEC’s membership includes senior leaders from the LOBs, and the firmwide Climate Risk Executive, among others.

An example of this is our work in the Aviation sector, a carbon-intensive sector of our financing portfolio, where we are helping advance the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”). SAF is an alternative fuel that has the potential to achieve up to 80% life cycle emissions reductions compared to fossil-jet fuel, and represents one of the most important levers for decarbonization of the Aviation sector in the near-to-medium term.\\nJPMorgan Chase is a founding member of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (“SABA”), an initiative spearheaded by Rocky Mountain Institute (“RMI”) and Environmental Defense Fund (“EDF”). SABA’s mission is to accelerate the path to climate neutral air transport by driving investment in high-quality SAF, catalyzing new SAF production and technological innovation, and supporting member engagement in policymaking. To date, the Firm has also purchased 2,200 SAF certificates in support of these objectives. \\nThe Firm is also an investor in the United Airlines Venture Sustainable Flight Fund, which is a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle designed to support early-stage companies focused on decarbonizing air travel by accelerating the research, production and technologies associated with SAF.\\nSee page 12 for additional levers that we believe help advance decarbonization of key sectors in our financing portfolio.\\n7\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our initiatives are rooted in how we do business: this means serving our customers, clients and communities while running a healthy and vibrant company. Examples of this work include: using our capital and expertise to support clients in advancing their low-carbon transition goals, and in turn, advancing progress toward our own net zero aligned targets (see pages 10–12 and 24–28); deploying our philanthropic capital to support initiatives that help vulnerable communities globally advance their resilience to climate change; and evaluating and managing potential risks — such as E&S and climate risks — within our business (see pages 16–22).\\nAddressing Our Financed Emissions Through Our Net Zero \\nAligned Targets\\nA key aspect of our environmental sustainability strategy is how we engage with our clients who operate in carbon-intensive industries, with the \\ngoal of accelerating the low-carbon transition and encouraging near-term actions that will set a path for global net zero emissions by 2050. \\nIn support of our strategy, we are aligning key sectors of our financing portfolio8 with net zero emissions by 2050. To date, we have set net zero \\naligned targets for eight sectors — Oil & Gas, Electric Power, Auto Manufacturing, Iron & Steel, Cement, Aviation and new for this year, Shipping and Aluminum — and have published our \\nCarbon CompassSM methodology  detailing our approach, including key sectoral considerations, \\ndecarbonization pathways, and data and metrics used. Our net zero aligned targets are currently constructed for 2030 as portfolio-level targets by sector, using an emissions intensity reduction metric. We set targets using our own independent assessment of what we determine is reasonable and achievable to serve the best interests of our business and serving our clients while remaining true to our principles.\\nIn 2021, when we first established our emissions intensity reduction targets for the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors, we aligned them to the then available International Energy Agency Sustainable Development Scenario (“IEA SDS”), which is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and generally accepted as aiming for achievement of net zero emissions by 2070. As climate science has advanced, this year we are updating our targets for the Oil & Gas, Electric Power, and Auto Manufacturing sectors to align them with the IEA Net Zero Emission by 2050 Scenario (“IEA NZE”) — a scenario that has become a widely used benchmark in the financial sector for net zero alignment. While there are a variety of differences between the IEA SDS and IEA NZE scenarios, the shift in ambition from net zero by 2070 to net zero by 2050 is significant — reflecting our support for actions toward global achievement of net zero emissions by 2050.\\nIn conjunction with updating our targets to the IEA NZE scenario, we have also expanded the boundary of our Oil & Gas End Use (Scope 3) target to include zero-carbon power generation from our Electric Power portfolio. Now called Energy Mix, our expanded target recognizes a singular focus on fossil fuels will not successfully achieve the necessary transition of the global energy system. Therefore, our targets should aim to reflect the reality that we also need to prioritize a significant build-out of clean energy sources. In addition, the build-out of zero-carbon power is taking place primarily in the Electric power sector.\\nOur Energy Mix target therefore builds on our previous Oil & Gas End Use emissions intensity reduction target, reflects our financing of zero-carbon power generation, and provides a clearer view on how our financing relates to the Scope 3 emissions performance of the broader energy system. We believe this revised target better reflects our strategy of supporting the rapid build-out of zero-carbon power, which we expect will help replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions without compromising energy security and affordability. Please see pages 24–25 in the Metrics & Targets chapter for additional information.KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR APPROACH\\nOur Carbon CompassSM methodology  incorporates and expands upon several related approaches to define robust, decision-useful metrics and \\nscience-based targets on a sector-by-sector basis. The following key choices and considerations informed how we designed our approach:We are also setting new net zero aligned targets for the Shipping and Aluminum sectors. Building on the approach and foundation of our other targets, these new targets are also intended to align to the IEA NZE scenario. \\nWe aim to continue expanding this work over time for additional carbon-intensive sectors in our financing portfolio, engaging with our clients on their decarbonization journeys, and aligning that work with global climate goals, science-based scenarios, and evolving best practices for the financial sector. Progress towards our targets is subject to market conditions, along with technological and public policy advancements.\\nBelow, we summarize key elements of our approach and our strategy for driving progress toward our targets, while in the Metrics & Targets chapter (see pages 24–28) we provide details of our net zero aligned targets, baselines and performance to date, including our updated targets and new sector targets. We also include disclosure of our financed emissions on an absolute basis (i.e., absolute financed emissions) for selected sectors of our portfolio.\\n8 Our financing portfolio refers to 12-month average of our committed balance sheet lending and tax equity transactions, as well as 100% attribution of our share in facilitated capital markets transactions with in-scope clients.•Science-based. Our targets build on the transition pathways outlined by the IEA NZE scenario. We also reference a wide range of publicresources, including additional climate scenarios, decarbonization research and other frameworks for assessing alignment with globalemission reduction goals.\\n•Sector-specific. Within each sector, we focus on specific activities with material emissions and credible pathways toward decarbonization,enabling us to gain more useful insight and better support our clients in developing and implementing their strategies.\\n•Decision-useful. For each sector, we define one or more core metrics that provide insights into companies’ performance and progresstoward decarbonization, and that are compatible with the benchmark trajectories we use to evaluate alignment to global emissions goals.\\n•Robust and consistent data.

Our CAF aims to provide a consistent, comprehensive, and data-driven approach to assess our client’s emissions and decarbonization plans. \\nWe use the CAF to assess how new in-scope transactions may affect progress toward our net zero aligned targets. Within the framework, we assess two key scores for each client: a CAF quantitative score and a CAF qualitative score (collectively known as the CAF scores). \\nThe quantitative score for each client is comprised of three pillars: (i) their historical emissions reductions; (ii) their current carbon intensity; and (iii) their projected carbon intensity based on their decarbonization targets. The qualitative score considers a variety of factors, including corporate struc-tures for governance and oversight, which enable us to take a holistic view of how the client plans to advance their decarbonization goals. \\nThe client-level CAF quantitative and qualitative scores are sourced from our Climate Risk infrastructure. Our Risk teams also use these client-level scores for internal risk analysis purposes, described further on page 20.\\nQUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT\\nCAF QUANTITATIVE SCORE (1–5) CAF QUALITATIVE SCORE (1–5)QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT\\nBucket 1 Bucket 2 Bucket 3 Bucket 4 Bucket 5\\nLOWEST HIGHESTClient’s integration of climate risk and opportunities in corporate strategy\\nClient’s investments toward decarbonizationClient is scored relative to JPMorgan Chase’s sector portfolio \\ntarget , as applicableForecasted Carbon Intensity\\nHistorical Carbon Intensity Reduction Client is scored based on the 2-year change in its carbon intensityClient is scored relative to JPMorgan Chase's applicable portfolio Current Carbon IntensityHolistic view of the client's plans and actions to achieve its decarbonization plans including:\\nClient’s Board oversight and corporate governance of climate-related mattersKey Aspects of Our Carbon Assessment Framework\\nHOW WE ARE USING CAF\\nAs we continue to expand our sector-specific emissions intensity reduction targets, we are also focused on aligning our capabilities and efforts to make progress toward them. Our goal is to use our knowledge and expertise to support clients in navigating the low-carbon transition — helping \\nthem think through and act on their decarbonization plans — while also aiming to achieve emissions reductions across our financing portfolio.\\nDecision-making and Portfolio Management: We consider the CAF as one element of our decision-making for new in-scope transactions in our targeted sectors. The CAF process, and governance around the same, have been integrated into the various deal execution processes for each sector across credit and capital markets financing for all in-scope transactions. While all transactions are assessed on an individual basis with a holistic view of many factors, the CAF allows us to assess how each new transaction may affect progress toward our emissions intensity reduction targets. Accountability for progress toward the targets has been assigned to senior leaders with the relevant banking teams at a regional- and sector-specific level.

We believe CAF is a reasonably designed framework, and we aim to continue looking for improvement opportunities and to enhance and mature the CAF methodology over time. We plan to continue to expand the use of CAF assessments to encompass additional sectors and financing that we provide to in-scope clients of our Carbon Compass\\nSM methodology.\\nINTEGRATING CAF ACROSS OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES\\nWe are dedicating resources to enable a technology-based integration of our CAF throughout our relevant business processes. For example, by embedding our CAF into our deal origination processes, we are better enabling our coverage and product deal teams to complete CAF assessments for in-scope transactions, and our risk teams to verify information feeding into the assessments, increasing their robustness and confidence. This integration has also better equipped our client coverage teams to identify areas where we can further strengthen our support to clients in implementing their decarbonization strategies.We recognize that different factors — such as technology development and scalability — beyond our and our clients’ control will pose difficulties in the low-carbon journey, and we continue to engage with our clients and support their decarbonization efforts. The table below gives a few examples of areas where we are engaging with our clients to provide additional support by delivering strategic advice, as well as providing capital and structured financing solutions to help them in achieving their decarbonization goals. We see these as levers that advance decarbonization of the different sectors where our clients operate and can contribute to our progress toward our emissions intensity reduction targets.\\n12\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our reported environmental footprint primarily stems from the operation of our more than 6,000 corporate offices, bank branches and data centers around the world. Our strategy \\nfor minimizing this impact focuses on optimizing how we source and use energy, reducing direct and indirect GHG emissions, and enhancing resource management, including in how we design and operate our buildings, and through our supply chain. In support of these efforts, we’ve set a number of operational sustainability targets. To view our progress toward these targets, our operational GHG emissions data and renewable energy use see pages 31–32 in Metrics & Targets.\\nThe Firm’s Chief Administrative Office (“CAO”) provides multiple global services that support the day-to-day operations of the Firm’s businesses. The CAO includes the Operational Sustainability team, responsible for the Firm’s operational carbon management strategy and for coordinating the implementation of operational sustainability efforts across the corporate functions; the Global Real Estate team, responsible for the deployment of onsite renewable energy, implementation of energy efficiency and water use minimization measures; and the Supplier Sustainability Team, responsible for providing oversight of the Firm’s supply chain with respect to ESG matters.\\nEnergy Optimization and GHG Emission Reduction\\nWe are pursuing efforts to optimize energy use and reduce our GHG footprint across our global operations, guided by our targets, including reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 40% by 2030 vs. a 2017 baseline, sourcing renewable energy for 100% of our global power needs annually, satisfying at least 70% of our renewable energy goal with on-site generation and long-term renewable energy contracts by 2025, and maintaining carbon neutral operations annually\\n. With these goals in mind, our strategy focuses on the following:9\\nIMPROVING EFFICIENCY AND ACCELERATING ELECTRIFICATION\\nReducing energy use and using less carbon-intensive energy sources are our first priorities. We continue to undertake a variety of energy efficiency measures, including reducing the physical footprint and power consumption of our data centers and optimizing the use of heating and cooling in our buildings.\\nAnother key energy and emissions reduction opportunity is electrification. To this end, we intend to design and build fully electrified retail branches, where feasible, and make greater use of electric transportation, including using vendors who offer electric vehicles and aiming to transition JPMorgan Chase’s owned vehicle fleet\\n to electric by the end of 2025.10SOURCING RENEWABLES \\nOur second priority is to transition to zero-carbon energy sources, for which we are working to scale our use of renewable energy from both on-site solar installations and long-term energy procurement contracts. We are aiming to increase our commercial on-site solar program to over 90MW by end of 2025, and we have made on-site solar a feature of our new branches\\n with the goal of increasing total solar capacity of our retail locations to over \\n25MW by end of 2024. 11\\nTo complement our on-site solar program, we continue to expand our use of long-term power purchase agreements and green power supply contracts across our global operations and have renewable energy agreements serving office locations in Europe and India. PURCHASING ENERGY ATTRIBUTE CERTIFICATES (\"EACS\") AND CARBON \\nCREDITS\\nFinally, to complement our emission reduction strategy, continue to meet our target to source \\nrenewable energy for 100% of our global power needs annually and address the remainder of our reported direct and indirect emissions, we purchase applicable EACs (e.g., Green-E certified Renewable Energy Certificates (\"RECs\"), International-RECs) and carbon credits\\n.12\\nIn addition to the above efforts, we are exploring and committing capital toward net zero and sustainable design for our branches, smart building management, and other strategies to enhance environmental sustainability of our operations and real estate portfolio.

Our strategy is supported and strengthened by our ongoing efforts to enhance accountability, transparency and engagement.\\nAccountability\\nWe strive to leverage the Firm’s robust management structures to foster sound management and a culture of accountability on ESG matters. This includes defining oversight and management of climate-related initiatives within and across our LOBs to monitor their progress as part of regular business reviews. We aim for transparency and accountability by reporting progress against key financing and operational targets annually including processes and controls for data disclosure and verification. \\nPublic Reporting\\nWe recognize stakeholders’ interest in timely information concerning our climate-related strategies and activities. We plan to continue to provide information through a number of channels including our Annual Report and Proxy Statement, ESG and Climate reporting, regulatory filings, website, press releases, direct conversations with stakeholders, and various other reports and presentations. \\nWe intend to continue to leverage market-leading and investor-focused climate reporting initiatives to inform the development of our climate-related disclosures. We are also closely monitoring regulatory developments related to mandatory climate reporting requirements in several jurisdictions around the world. \\nStakeholder Engagement\\nOur key stakeholders include customers and clients, shareholders, employees, communities, regulators and policymakers, research analysts and suppliers. We engage with stakeholders throughout the year to obtain insight into their needs and perspectives, as well as to gather feedback on our strategy and performance, including as they relate to climate change.  Strengthening Our Sustainability Initiatives Through Employee Engagement \\nWe encourage our employees to think about how they can live more sustainably. For example, through our Global Sustainability Series events, we give employees an opportunity to participate in insightful and inspiring discussions showcasing the Firm’s sustainability leaders and experts from around the globe.\\nOur GoGreen program, a global network of employee-led volunteer teams, works to foster a community of informed, engaged and inspired employees who contribute to our sustainability culture. The mission of the GoGreen teams is to increase employee awareness of sustainability initiatives at JPMorgan Chase, including our sustainability targets, and what the Firm is doing to meet them, as well as offer employees opportunities to learn about and engage in sustainable activities at work, at home and in their communities. During the first half of 2023, GoGreen team events and activities included: \\nRealizing Environmental Benefits through Engagement with Our Suppliers \\nWe recognize that the environmental impact of our operations extends to our suppliers’ practices. As such, we aim to work with suppliers who are working to improve their environmental sustainability. As an example, the Firm recently collaborated with a transportation supplier in Mumbai, India to upgrade commuter buses shuttling roughly 14,000 employees to and from the Firm’s campuses. The upgraded buses have onboard diagnostic devices that monitor emissions and identify malfunctioning components that could cause problems and affect the vehicle’s emission performance. These upgrades are expected to lead to an estimated 34% reduction in the upgraded buses’ annual GHG emissions compared to 2022.\\nTo further our efforts, in 2023, we also established new Supplier Environmental Sustainability Guidelines, which are designed to educate our suppliers as to how they can integrate positive environmental practices within their own organizations and to set the foundation for further incorporating environmental considerations into our procurement process. Educating Our Workforce On Climate\\nWe are enhancing our ability to support our clients in navigating their low-carbon transition journeys, achieving their climate goals and executing on value creation strategies. We provide our banking teams across LOBs with climate-related resources covering a wide range of topics, including climate-related regulatory updates; key technologies, financing options and investment opportunities of the climate transition; and sector-specific decarbonization pathways.• Offering hands-on events in support of UN World Water Day where employees learned about water access challenges in developing nations.\\n• Hosting local biodiversity themed events around the globe in celebration of UN World Earth Day.\\n• Collaborating with local community organizations to host beach and riverbank clean-ups, tree planting, litter clearing and invasive species removal.\\n• Staging sustainability fairs to provide employees with opportunities to discover locally made sustainable products and services.\\n• Sponsoring learning sessions with sustainability experts on topics such as composting and gardening at home, recycling and waste management, and JPMorgan Chase’s corporate beekeeping program to provide safe pollinator habitats for honeybees.\\n• Participating alongside the Firm and millions of others around the globe in World Earth Hour, going dark for one hour in our homes and within more than 30 JPMorgan Chase build-ings to show our support for climate action.\\n14\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our business is subject to extensive laws and regulations, and changes to such laws can significantly affect how we operate, our revenues and the costs we incur. Because of the impact public policy can have on our businesses, employees, communities and customers, we engage with policymakers holding a range of views, on a range of issues — including banking, financial services, cybersecurity, workforce development, small business, tax, trade, and inclusive economic growth, among others — to advance and protect the long-term interests of the Firm.  \\nWe recognize the need for thoughtful public policy on climate- and energy-related matters. It can help accelerate the Firm’s progress on sustainability-related business objectives and contribute to sustainable economic growth. It is among the prerequisites we view as essential to make the achievement of our and others’ climate targets feasible. We therefore engage with external stakeholders and trade associations on policies that we believe can help make net zero goals achievable, including by mobilizing capital for green technology and solutions, and supporting clients as they navigate the low-carbon transition.\\nExamples of our recent climate-related public policy and industry engagements include:\\n• Supporting Rocky Mountain Institute with a grant for their Accelerating Clean Regional Economies initiative, which convenes business, policy, economic development, workforce, and NGO stakeholders to prioritize and advance local clean technology industries (for example, battery and electric vehicle manufacturing in the Great Lakes region).\\n• Convening over 30 individuals from community development financial institutions, NGOs, and philanthropies to discuss the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — particularly how its capital can best support underserved communities and the best ways to support applicants seeking funds. \\nThe Firm belongs to a number of trade associations that advocate on major public policy issues of importance to the Firm and the communities we serve. The Firm’s participation in these associations comes with the understanding that we may not always align with all their positions or those of its other members. We make independent decisions as a Firm, and we may provide appropriate feedback on the efforts by these associations. A list of the Firm’s principal trade associations is disclosed in our \\nPolitical Engagement Report .Similarly, the Firm may engage with industry initiatives to help address complex global challenges, including climate change, where we are aligned with the initiatives’ goals and can continue to exercise our own business judgment based on the best interest of the Firm and serving our clients. We also participate in a variety of initiatives focused on advancing sustainability. Three examples are:\\n• We made a $2.5 million grant to the EFI Foundation to support their work on the Energy Futures Finance Forum (“EF3”). The initiative, launched at an event hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center in February 2023, is led by former Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz. EF3 engages across stakeholder groups to recommend policies intended to increase deployment of key decarbonization technologies. Its initial framing report focused on the need to increase clean energy project financial viability to attract the necessary private capital to fund de-carbonization efforts at commercial scale. A subsequent report applied this framework to carbon capture and storage (“CCS”), and offered policy recommendations such as enhancing federal government support of first-of-a-kind projects on CCS and supporting infrastructure like pipelines; disclosing performance data for taxpayer supported projects; and fostering community engagement as CCS projects develop. The EF3 Advisory Board includes members of JPMorgan Chase, the investor community, and civil society. \\n• We contribute to public discourse by voicing our views on certain developments in climate policy. In February 2023, two JPMorgan Chase senior leaders published an op-ed in Fortune describing the Firm’s approach toward recent laws passed in the U.S. that support climate and clean energy investment, including the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These federal investments aim to help to reinvigorate do-mestic manufacturing, build resilient supply chains, create jobs, and cut energy costs — all while making progress on the climate challenge. \\n• We are increasing our engagements with oil and gas companies, technology innovators, non-governmental organizations and multi-stake-holder initiatives to support methane emissions reductions and improved methane emissions data quality. Through our engagements, we encourage adoption of technologies to monitor and measure emissions to improve accuracy and transparency of data, and to foster near-term emission mitigation.

Acute physical risk drivers include increased frequen-cy or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea level rise, persistent changes in precipitation levels and increase in average ambient temperatures. Indirect physical risk drivers include the second-order effects of these acute and chronic risks, such as supply chain disruptions or changes to property valuations.• Transition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a low-carbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.\\nOur climate risk framework sets forth the capabilities JPMorgan Chase uses to identify, assess and manage the impacts of physical and transition risk drivers on each of our four risk types. This framework is comprised of six core firmwide risk capabilities central to enabling assessment, \\nquantification and managemen\\nt of the climate risks that may manifest across our diverse global footprint. In this chapter, we discuss Risk Governance, Risk Identification, Scenario Analysis, and Risk Measurement capabilities of this framework.

In some cases, the “first-order” impacts may build over time and trigger the “second-order” impacts — for example, repeated business disruption following severe weather events may lead to higher insurance costs in the local area — although this is not necessarily the case.Physical and Transition Risk\\n18\\n\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We use internationally recognized scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) to inform our measurement of the potential financial and economic impacts to the Firm from the manifestation of climate risks.\\nThe NGFS and IPCC scenarios represent widely accepted plausible pathways for society’s future GHG emissions and consider the complex interactions between global socioeconomic systems and natural Earth systems over time. The average global temperature in 2022 was approximately 1.15°C above pre-industrial levels (1850–1900).\\n We define this as the “current state” of the climate, \\nwith assessments of future physical and transition risk based on further warming above this state.14Transition Risk Scenario Analysis\\nThe Firm applies macroeconomic and industry-specific variables (e.g., Oil & Gas demand, steel production, etc.) from NGFS scenarios to help assess potential transition risk impacts to the Firm. In order to quantify and understand the range of these impacts, we are using a “baseline” transition risk scenario and a “severe” transition risk scenario from the NGFS.\\nSEVERE SCENARIO\\nThe NGFS Divergent Net Zero (“DNZE”) scenario represents the most severe transition risk scenario. The scenario assumes that global net zero is reached by 2050 through higher carbon prices with a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, despite divergence in policies introduced by governments across the world. The scenario assumes that global warming is successfully limited to 1.5°C by 2100, which limits physical risk impacts.BASELINE SCENARIO\\nThe NGFS Current Policies (“CP”) scenario represents a low-transition risk scenario that captures the current state of global climate policy. The scenario assumes that no future emissions reduction policies are implemented by governments, leading to high physical risks.\\n In this scenario, 3°C or more of warming could occur by 2100.15 16Physical Risk Scenario Analysis\\nThe Firm applies IPCC-derived physical risk parameters to assess the potential impacts of the increasing frequency and severity of severe weather events on our business operations, credit exposures, and collateral locations. Consistent with the transition risk approach, we utilize both a “baseline” physical risk scenario and a “severe” physical risk scenario to inform the range of outcomes.\\nBASELINE SCENARIO\\nThe IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (“RCP”) 4.5 scenario represents an intermediate, middle-of-the-road scenario where social, economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals; overall, the intensity resource and energy use declines. The scenario assumes that global mean temperature reaches 2.7°C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100.SEVERE SCENARIO\\nThe IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario represents the worst-case, highest emissions scenario. The scenario assumes that global mean temperature reaches 4.4°C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100 due to the continued exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and a continued rise in resource- and energy-intensive activities around the world. Under this scenario, there is no transition to a low-carbon economy and GHG emissions continue to rise throughout the 21\\nst century.\\nTime Horizons\\nThe pace and cumulative effects of climate change are important factors in considering the potential financial and economic implications. We therefore analyze these scenarios over multiple periods.\\n• Short-term: Less than 5 years; aligned with the Firm’s  loss and capital adequacy assessments.\\n14 World Meteorological Organization\\n15 NGFS Scenario Portal \\n16 Temperature increases are relative to global mean temperatures at pre-industrial levels (1850–1900).19\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We \\nleverage our risk identification and scenario analysis to measure the potential adverse impacts the baseline and severe climate risk scenarios may have on our credit portfolios, both today and into the future. We are analyzing the direct impacts of physical and transition risk — considering property damage and financial loss due to severe weather events or the potential reduction in profitability of a client, counterparty or customer as a result of a societal transition from a high-carbon to a lower carbon-intensive footprint. We are also considering indirect and longer-term risk drivers, including the potential for reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase in a given geography, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. \\nCONSUMER CREDIT RISK\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had $1.4 trillion of consumer credit exposure, including residential real estate, auto loans and credit cards. The Firm uses catastrophe models to estimate the potential impact of hypothetical severe weather events on its real estate portfolios. For example, retained residential real estate loans, predominantly in the U.S., made up $238 billion of the total consumer credit portfolio. Today, climate risks for this portfolio are substantially mitigated through geographic diversification of the properties, the prevalence of hazard insurance, and the effective average life of the underlying loans, among other factors. As a result, financial losses due to severe weather events have not been material to the Firm. As we examine the potential for future impacts, we may consider outcomes in which these mitigants are weakened — for example, if insurance becomes less prevalent.\\nThe cumulative effect of physical climate risk may impact our residential real estate portfolio in several ways, including the following: \\n• Greater physical damages: increased likelihood or severity of severe weather events may increase consumer credit losses.\\n• Higher insurance premiums: higher insurance premiums may increase living expenses and financial burden for consumers.\\n• Reduced coverage or availability of insurance: insurers may further limit types of damage they cover or withdraw coverage from specific geographies.\\n• House price impacts: cumulative effect of climate-driven events may adversely impact house prices and local economies in certain geogra-phies, potentially disproportionately impacting lower-income households and communities.\\nAdditionally, we continue to examine how the transition to a low-carbon economy may create financial burden on consumers from potentially higher energy prices, pass-through of carbon taxes on goods and services, or result in declines in the value of other assets (e.g., gas-burning vehicles), which could impact consumers’ ability to repay credit obligations and may result in additional credit losses to the Firm.WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had $1.2 trillion of wholesale credit exposure. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. \\nThe Firm has built a stress framework to estimate potential impacts from a range of climate transition pathways on client financials and credit ratings. For clients operating in carbon-intensive sectors (e.g., Oil & Gas, Automotive Manufacturing, Power Generation, Steel and Cement Manufacturing), the Firm estimates the potential impact of a climate transition scenario on their credit rating by projecting detailed cashflows within the context of a transition scenario (see Scenario Analysis on page 19). This estimation takes into account the client-level CAF quantitative and qualitative scores, which, as described on pages 11–12, assesses a client’s historical emissions reductions, current and forecasted carbon intensity, as well as actions taken to advance their decarbonization.\\nFinancial impacts from the transition to a low-carbon economy could manifest in a variety of ways, including weaker demand for carbon-intensive products, resulting in lower revenue, or higher operating costs for carbon-emitting companies, if a carbon tax is implemented. Additionally, companies may need to increase their capital expenditures through investments that improve resilience to the low-carbon transition (e.g., power companies investing in renewables). \\nTo assess the impact of climate transition risk on sectors with relatively lower carbon intensity, the Firm conducts a separate client-specific internal stress analysis\\n. The potential effect on a client’s credit rating is estimated by stressing client financials consistent with industry \\nprojected performance in the transition scenario, and factoring in the additional costs incurred due to a carbon tax on the company’s emissions.17\\nThe Firm has also developed risk management capabilities including catastrophe modelling to estimate the potential impact of severe weather events exacerbated by climate change on its Commercial Real Estate portfolio. Damages from hurricanes and floods could cause potential physical damage to the underlying properties, leading to expenses for repairs and disruptions in revenue, as well as changes in overall property values thus impacting the credit quality of the portfolio.We are using our resources to better understand how physical and transition risks may manifest and their potential impacts on the existing risk types the Firm manages.\\n17 Climate transition stress analysis for clients in lower carbon intensity sectors is used for internal climate analysis and not used in client decisioning.20\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Climate risk drivers may lead to sharp volatility or persistent changes in the prices of commodities and financial assets; for example, companies in carbon intensive industry sectors without credible transition plans may have assets which are viewed as stranded, resulting in materially depressed equity prices. The Firm has established a stress framework to quantify the impact of the transition risk stress scenarios to vulnerable asset classes. We have also analyzed a series of physical drivers to estimate the potential impacts of various acute and chronic physical risk events to markets exposures. \\nCountry Risk\\nThe Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments, which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The negative implications from climate change may impact a country’s economic, fiscal, monetary or political frameworks in numerous ways, in turn, adversely affecting its sovereign credit ratings. Climate risk considerations are incorporated, as appropriate, into existing sovereign ratings and risk management processes. In addition, the Firm has developed a score to help explore the potential sensitivity of sovereign ratings to climate risks beyond the standard rating horizon or under specific stress scenarios.\\nOperational Risk\\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. We have integrated climate risk drivers into our operational risk framework and associated firmwide resiliency processes. Increasingly volatile and severe weather events, including more severe storms, flooding, heat and related impacts, such as drought and wildfires, have the potential to impact the likelihood and severity of a variety of existing operational risks. \\nPotential climate driven impacts are evaluated through ongoing assessments of operational risks to employees and customers, the Firm’s facilities, property and service providers, and the Firm’s business activities. Evaluations are documented and may also contribute to the firmwide risk identification framework, which centrally captures risks across all risk types. As an example, the Firm uses these risks to develop business disruption threat scenarios that inform business resiliency planning, testing and simulation exercises. This, in turn, allows the Firm to assess the adequacy of its resiliency capabilities and identify vulnerabilities and opportunities for enhancement. These activities, along with other factors, help enable the Firm to manage and mitigate climate-driven impacts.Strategic Risk\\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate response to changes in the operating environment. In response to climate change, and in support of our clients transitioning to a lower-carbon economy, the Firm may make changes to its business strategy, product offerings and risk profile. \\nREPUTATION RISK\\nReputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees, communities or the broader public. Reputational risk assessment is designed to take into account the commercial consequences of actions or inactions that may impact clients, customers, employees, capital providers and other stakeholders. In many cases we recognize that a position we take will be favored by some and disapproved of by others, and where all positions including neutrality can be controversial.\\nClimate- and environmental-related business strategies and activities are under increasing scrutiny. Companies are also facing reputational risk from the real or perceived lack of progress made toward climate-related targets, as well as in how they provide transparency around climate-related matters. The Firm may face reputation risk relating to its climate risk framework and environmental sustainability strategy.  \\nLIQUIDITY RISK\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. The Firm’s liquidity could be impaired by factors such as market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral and lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general.\\nThe Firm has expanded its liquidity stress framework to model the impact of a transition risk stress scenario using the NGFS Divergent Net Zero scenario.\\n22\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In this report, we also disclose our financed emissions on an absolute basis (i.e., absolute financed emissions) for the eight sectors above, and discuss how we are managing data challenges we face in constructing baselines and monitoring progress toward our targets.\\nUPDATING OUR TARGETS\\nWe aim for our climate strategy to be science-based, reliant on data-driven insights, and designed to adapt as data quality and availability progress. In 2021, we set 2030 interim emissions intensity reduction targets for three sectors — Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing. As the first large U.S. bank to do so, we aligned these targets with the then available IEA SDS scenario. Since the publication of the IEA NZE scenario, which aims to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we have aimed to align all new targets — Iron & Steel, Cement and Aviation in 2022, as well as Shipping and Aluminum for 2023 — with this scenario. To maintain this consistent approach across all of our targets, we are now updating our targets for the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors to align to the more ambitious IEA NZE scenario. Details on updates for each of the targets are provided in the following sections.Balancing Environmental, Social and Economic Needs\\nOIL & GAS OPERATIONAL\\nWe have increased our Oil & Gas Operational target from 35% to 45% to align with the IEA \\nNZE sc\\nenario. While the overall emissions reduction framework and decarbonization levers \\nremain unchanged, we aim to continue our engagement with our clients on key impact areas such as fugitive and vented methane emissions and CO\\n2 from flaring.\\nELECTRIC POWER\\nIn updating our Electric Power target to align with the IEA NZE scenario, we have also \\nr\\nevised our target to take into account our financing activities to companies in countries \\noutside of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Projections for the OECD region assume more stringent (i.e., lower) carbon intensities than those for non-OECD countries, reflecting the expectation that OECD countries will transition more aggressively in the near term. Considering that the current distribution of companies in our Electric Power portfolio has a smaller share of non-OECD representation than the world overall, we have calibrated our target to take into account the split of clients in our portfolio between OECD and non-OECD member countries.AUTO MANUFACTURING\\nWhen we first derived our portfolio baseline and 2030 target, we relied on scenarios \\nand inputs that used the Ne\\nw European Driving Cycle (“NEDC”) testing procedure for \\nmeasuring fuel economy and CO 2 emissions. Since then, a new global standard — Worldwide \\nHarmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (“WLTP”) — that more closely simulates real-world driving conditions to estimate emissions was adopted.

The IEA NZE scenario pathways reflect more reliance on electrification, and in, turn zero-carbon power, than the IEA SDS scenario to which our original target was aligned. Although the Oil & Gas End Use (Scope 3) IEA SDS-aligned target was challenging, it was potentially feasible with a narrow boundary focused on the decarbonization efforts of the Oil & Gas sector alone. While the Oil & Gas sector is leading in biofuels and CCUS investments, the build-out of zero-carbon power is taking place primarily in the Electric Power sector. Therefore, with the change to the IEA NZE scenario, we are expanding the scope of our Oil & Gas End Use (Scope 3) target — now called Energy Mix — to include zero carbon power generation activity from our Electric Power portfolio and better capture how our financing is helping to facilitate the substitution of fossil fuels with zero- and low-carbon alternatives. \\nWhile we have expanded our target to include zero-carbon power generation \\nactivity from our Elec tric Po\\nwer portfolio, we have also increased the ambition \\nof our target. Our IEA SDS aligned target for Oil & Gas End Use was to achieve a 15% reduction by 2030 from our 2019 baseline. Aligning this target with the IEA NZE scenario would require an increase to a 29% reduction. The expansion to Energy Mix, which includes all zero-carbon power generation in our target’s boundary, implies a global carbon intensity of 29.5 g CO\\n2/MJ (or a 33% reduction \\nbetween 2019 and 2030) under the IEA NZE scenario. Given that our 2019 baseline exceeded the 2019 global level, we are setting an adjusted target of a 36% reduction by 2030 from our 2019 baseline to align with a carbon intensity of 29.5 g CO\\n2/MJ required under the IEA NZE scenario.\\nWe believe this updated target better captures the shift in fuel mix of the global energy complex, and balanc\\nes the trade-offs between fossil-fuel based and zero- or \\nlow-carbon energy sources to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Our approach allows further engagement with our Oil & Gas clients on their Scope 3 decarbonization plans, while also accelerating our financing of zero-carbon power generation, and enables us to balance energy transition needs and energy security concerns.\\nWe will maintain a separate Oil & Gas Operational (Scope 1 & 2) net zero aligned \\ntarget that focuses on key oper\\national decarbonization actions that we believe are \\nthe most relevant for emission reduction in the Oil & Gas sector, such as mitigating methane emissions and minimizing flaring. We will also maintain our Electric Power target that focuses specifically on the decarbonization of electric grids. Due to the integrated nature of our Energy Mix target, and its partial overlap with our existing Electric Power target, we will include our financing of zero-carbon power generation activities in both targets’ calculations, which we believe is consistent with the IEA NZE scenario’s treatment of global power generation.i.

As of December 31, 2022, we have driven a significant amount of progress (approximately 15% reduction from baseline) toward our Energy Mix target. This change is largely attributable to our increased financing of zero-carbon power generation coupled with a reduction in our exposure to the Oil & Gas sector, despite oil and natural gas demand staying largely unchanged between 2021 and 2022. The reduction in exposure to the Oil & Gas sector is primarily a function of the industry’s external financing needs — especially from debt and equity capital markets — reducing amid a strong commodity price environment that prevailed over 2021 and 2022. Similar to our approach before the expansion of our metric, we have sustained our efforts to engage with our Oil & Gas clients to help them design pathways to reduce the carbon intensity of their product mix. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio’s Oil & Gas End Use carbon intensity metric would have been relatively flat, mirroring the trend seen across the global Oil & Gas sector during the same period. Our expectation remains that, over time, our Oil & Gas clients will tilt their energy mix to favor natural gas — which has a lower relative carbon intensity — over oil and invest in low-carbon fuels and other decarbonization technologies at scale. We also expect for non-combustible products to become a larger share of end use and to increase our financing of zero-carbon power generation across the energy complex and support the global energy transition.\\nWe provide additional information on the reconciliation from our Oil & Gas End Use target \\nbaseline to Energy Mix target progress on page 25. \\nOIL & GAS OPERATIONAL\\nWe have revised our Oil & Gas Operational 2019 baseline to reflect data quality improvements \\nover 2022 — see page 30 for more details on the data challenges we have experienced and how we are working to address them. Against this revised 2019 baseline, our portfolio emission intensity decreased by approximately 1%. Over the two years ending December 31, 2022, clients in our portfolio showed significant emissions intensity improvements; however, the reduction in exposure to the sector — and resulting shift in weights of each client — offset much of the impact from these improvements on our overall portfolio-level carbon intensity. We expect the portfolio will continue to benefit in the coming years from our engagement with our clients on key areas of focus, such as methane and flaring. \\ni.

Despite the lower revised baseline value, our Electric Power portfolio emissions intensity has decreased by approximately 17%, compared to the revised baseline, over the two years ending December 31, 2022. This decrease was driven by a combination of our clients moving their generation mix to lower emissions sources and the Firm increasing financing to companies and projects with lower emissions intensity. The expansion of our Energy Mix target to encompass zero-carbon power generation will further align progress in our Electric Power portfolio with our broader goal of increasing our financing of low- and zero-carbon energy, including renewables. \\nAUTO MANUFACTURING\\nWe have revised our Auto Manufacturing 2019 baseline to incorporate the change in data \\ninputs from NEDC to the WLTP. While this change better reflects real-world emissions of passenger vehicles, it results in a higher Scope 3 carbon intensity for clients in our baseline. Compared to the revised 2019 baseline, our portfolio emissions intensity has decreased by approximately 16% as of December 31, 2022. This was driven mainly by banking new and emerging pure-play EV manufacturers and the growing portfolio of EV offerings by legacy auto manufacturers. The sector’s overall effort to transition to an all-EV future, as well as the policy and market behavior changes that are catalyzing the shift are prerequisites and important considerations in allowing us to continue to make progress toward our portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction target. IRON & STEEL\\nWe have revised our Iron & Steel 2020 baseline to reflect data quality improvement. \\nCompared to our revised 2020 baseline, our portfolio emissions intensity has decreased by approximately 8% as of December 31, 2022. The decrease is largely attributable to improvements in client carbon intensity, with the remainder attributable to our portfolio exposure shifting to lower intensity clients.  We expect that the progress we are beginning to observe in clients’ emissions intensity will continue in the near- to medium-term as under construction electric arc furnaces (EAFs) are made available and clients increasingly rely on low- and zero-carbon sources of energy for their operations. Additionally, as clients increasingly recycle scrap, we anticipate a reduction in the need for iron inputs and the emissions associated with producing it. We are continuing to engage with our clients on their decarbonization initiatives and will continue to provide advisory and financing solutions to support them in their decarbonization efforts.\\nCEMENT\\nWe have also revised our 2020 baseline for our Cement portfolio to reflect data quality \\nimprovements. Compared to our revised 2020 baseline, our Cement portfolio emissions intensity has decreased by approximately 1% as of December 31, 2022. We remain optimistic on the sectors’ ability to invest in decarbonization efforts, as several clients, representing over half of our portfolio exposure, are beginning to reduce their carbon intensity. Given the sector’s reliance on carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technology to drive decarbonization and its relatively nascent scale today, we expect medium- to long-term progress to be more significant than what we have seen so far. AVIATION\\nOur Aviation portfolio’s emissions intensity has decreased by approximately 3% as of \\nDecember 31, 2022, compared to our 2021 baseline. Progress has been primarily driven by shifts in our portfolio weights toward clients with lower carbon intensity. \\nWe expect further progress in our Aviation portfolio as clients in the sector purchase \\nnew aircrafts and operator load factors continue to increase as air travel returns to pre-pandemic levels. However, scaling the availability of SAF, accelerated build-out of the SAF value chain, and airlines successfully securing SAF offtake agreements will be key to material decarbonization of the sector.\\n28\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The following provides additional detail on our approach to determining each of the three elements used in our calculation:\\n• Financing. To determine the amount of financing JPMorgan Chase has provided to a client, we include all lending, tax equity and \\ncapital markets activit\\ny. \\n• For lending and tax equity, we use the 12-month monthly average balance of committed financing. Using the 12-month monthly \\naver\\nage enables us to capture the impact of short-term obligations, such as bridge loans, which frequently have terms of less \\nthan one year. \\n• For capital markets activity — also known as facilitated emissions — we include 100% of our participation, on a three-year rolling aver\\nage basis. We chose 100% of our participation as we believe it provides a more complete picture of our financing activity and \\nhow we are supporting our clients through direct lending and capital markets facilitation. We use a three-year rolling average to address the significant volatility often observed with capital markets transactions, driven in part by companies typically only going to the market for additional financing every few years. \\n• Company Value. For the value of public companies, we use enterprise value including cash (“EVIC”). We use a three-year rolling aver\\nage of EVIC in order to control for potential distortion due to the effect of market volatility on company valuations. For the \\nvalue of private companies, we use the sum of total company equity and debt as found on the company’s balance sheet. We use a three-year rolling average of year-end equity and debt in order to control for potential short-term variation that could other -\\nwise distort our calculation of absolute financed emissions.\\n• Client Emissions. We include client absolute emissions within the same scopes and boundaries as we have defined for each of our sector-specific net z\\nero aligned targets and therefore rely on the same sources of client emissions data for each sector. Where our \\npreferred form of data is unavailable for a given client, we estimate absolute emissions using a revenue-based emissions factor based on the median of sector clients for which data is available. For a small number of companies in our portfolio, EVIC or equity and debt may be unavailable. In these cases, we estimate absolute financed emissions using an asset-based emissions factor based on the median of sector clients for which data is available (see our Carbon Compass\\nSM methodology for more information).\\nWhen calculating absolute financed emissions for a sector portfolio, we assign a data quality score for each client depending on the data and method used to determine absolute emissions for that client\\n, with 1 representing highest quality and 5 representing \\nlowest quality. This is consistent with the data quality scoring methodology recommended by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (“PCAF”). We then calculate and report a weighted average data quality score for each sector based on the financing provided to each client relative to our total financing to the sector. Assigning data quality scores helps us to understand the accuracy of the data used to calculate our absolute financed emissions, and to consider strategies for improving data quality over time. Reporting data quality scores helps us increase transparency and accountability. Our objective is to use high quality data to achieve as accurate as possible absolute financed emission accounting.\\nWe also calculate the economic emission intensity for each of the eight sectors of our financing portfolio, which can be useful \\nfor comparin\\ng different sector portfolio emissions by unit of lending or capital markets activity. We calculate economic emission \\nintensities by dividing the absolute financed emissions by the economic value of the activity (lending or capital markets).\\nWe aim to monitor evolving best practices on absolute financed emissions measurement to inform our methodology and plan to \\ncontinue to r\\neport annually on this metric. While we believe that our approach is suitable for our calculated absolute financed \\nemissions to correlate with real-world emissions performance, we also disclose a version of this metric aligned to PCAF within the appendix section of this report (see page 34).\\nFor more information on our approach, see the “Absolute Financed Emissions” section in our Carbon Compass\\nSM methodology .FINANCINGLending & Tax Equity 12-mo monthly average committed financing\\nCapital Markets 100% of Capital Markets activity on a 3-year rolling average basis\\nCOMPANY \\nVALUEPublic companies 3-year average enterprise value including cash (EVIC)\\nPrivate companies 3-year average year-end Debt + Equity\\nCLIENT  \\nABSOLUTE\\n  \\nEMISSIONSEnergy Mix Scope 3 CO 2 emissions from end use of energy products\\nOil & Gas Operational Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e from production and refining of oil, natural gas, bioenergy and other energy \\nproducts\\nElectric Power Scope 1 CO 2 from fuel combustion for power generation\\nAuto Manufacturing Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e from manufacturing\\nScope 3 end use tank-to-wheel CO 2e from fuel combustion\\nIron & Steel Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e — including energy-related and process emissions — from production of primary \\nand secondary crude steel\\nCement Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e from cement manufacturing\\nAviation Scope 1 tank-to-wake CO 2 from flights\\nAluminum Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e from smelting (primary production) and recycling (secondary production)\\nShipping Scope 1 tank-to-wake CO 2 from international shipping vessel operationsFAbsolute Financed Emissions  =  Σ(inancing×  Client Absolute Emissions\\nCompany Value )Measuring Our Absolute Financed Emissions \\nMeasuring and reporting our financed emissions on an absolute basis (i.e., absolute financed emissions) is a growing area of interest for many of \\nour stakeholders. Absolute financed emissions can be a useful metric in understanding the impact of our emission reduction efforts. We have taken steps to quantify and disclose absolute financed emissions for sectors of our financing portfolio for which we have set net zero aligned targets.\\nIn this section, we provide details of the absolute financed emissions associated with eight sectors of our financing portfolio, as well as our \\napproach to calculating them. W\\ne recognize the methodologies that exist today to calculate absolute financed emissions are still in early stages, \\nand we aim to monitor industry developments to inform our approach as data, methodologies and climate science continue to evolve.\\nOUR APPROACH TO CALCULATE OUR ABSOLUTE FINANCED EMISSIONS\\nOur methodology for calculating absolute financed emissions builds on international standards and guidance while also aiming to align with the principles and parameters underlying our sector-specific net zero aligned targets. We tailored our approach to focus on what we consider to be the most important sources of emissions for each sector, accounting for our financial exposure to each of our clients in those sectors and — to address one of the most significant challenges of measuring absolute financed emissions — minimizing distortion that may result from the effect of short-term market volatility on client valuations. We believe this approach calculates absolute financed emission figures that correlate with real-world emissions performance of clients in our applicable sector portfolios. \\nWe calculate absolute financed emissions for a given sector portfolio as follows:\\n29\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This section summarizes the key points on data considerations and challenges that we continue to face, as well as the steps we are taking to address them.\\nMEASUREMENT VS. ESTIMATION\\nThere are well-known challenges with the quality and reliability of emissions data in many sectors. This means we sometimes rely on estimated versus directly measured emissions data. For example, in the Oil & Gas sector, there are inconsistencies in the measurement, management and reporting of data across organizations, as well as the lack of reliable and standardized techniques for measurement in certain areas, such as methane emissions. As a result, reported methane emissions rely on estimation methods that are less accurate than direct measurement methods. We are working with industry partners and NGOs to help make direct measurement technologies the preferred method of tracking and reporting methane emissions. More generally, emerging best practices, including reporting to organizations that provide data aggregation services and soliciting assurance for reported GHG emissions data will help improve emission-related data quality and reliability.\\nDATA LAG\\nAnother challenge we consistently face is with the timely availability of data inputs to calculate carbon intensity. In the Auto Manufacturing sector, for example, certain data from regulatory sources can experience significant delays — sometimes up to two to three years. In such cases, we seek to address gaps using a defined data waterfall approach that may include company-disclosed figures, provided they are verified and prepared in line with recommended protocols that we have identified. Failing that, we use proxy values. As climate- and sustainability-focused disclosure becomes more standardized, we expect lags — especially on company-reported data — to reduce gradually. \\nCOMPARABLE METHODOLOGIES\\nWhile we seek to design and implement robust proxies that minimize the impact on our portfolio when preferred data becomes available, there are cases where this may not be achievable. For example, in our Electric Power portfolio, a small proportion of companies for which no data is available receive a default carbon intensity based on a relatively conservative proxy. Unless the company’s North America Industry Classification System codes or project financing use of proceeds indicate it to be a zero-emitting power producer, in which case it is assigned a carbon intensity of zero, the company is assigned a fuel mix that is equal parts coal and natural gas. However, due to the large differences between the emissions intensities of the different fuel types, there could be significant differences between estimates and actual data. To mitigate this, we are continuing to work with our clients and other stakeholders to improve overall quality and availability of data. We expect to periodically review our data sourcing choices to assess whether better alternatives have become available.\\nLACK OF DATA ON EMERGING DECARBONIZATION TECHNOLOGIES\\nEmerging technologies such as hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture, use and storage, and carbon credits — will play a key role in helping clients decarbonize. However, data availability in these areas remains a significant challenge. Innovative solutions continue to emerge — such as the use of blockchain to trace carbon credit ownership and retirement, mitigating concerns associated with the use of unverified public reports — but lack the scale today that is necessary to meaningfully impact our portfolio-level emissions intensity. We recognize that data in this space is evolving, and we expect to consider viable data solutions as they may become available.

Introduction \\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management \\n(“MSIM”)1 is the investment management division \\nof Morgan Stanley,2 and provides broad-based \\nspecialisation across a range of asset classes in \\npublic and private markets worldwide.3 MSIM has \\nbeen creating value for its clients for over 45 years \\nand operates in more than 20 countries. MSIM has \\n$1.5 trillion in assets under management (“AUM”) \\nas of December 31, 2023. MSIM’s independent \\ninvestment teams leverage Morgan Stanley’s \\nglobal resources to serve a diverse client base of \\ngovernments, institutions, corporations, advisors and \\nindividuals worldwide. MSIM’s investment solutions \\ninclude a broad range of high-conviction active \\nstrategies, alternatives, customisation strategies and \\nsustainability expertise. \\nMSIM believes that environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors may \\npresent investment risks and opportunities. Understanding and managing these risks \\nand opportunities may therefore contribute to both risk mitigation and long-term \\ninvestment returns. Engagement and stewardship are a key part of this understanding, \\nwhere investment teams seek to engage with the assets or companies they own, \\nseeking to deliver long-term value and this approach aligns with our objective to be \\nresponsible stewards of our clients’ capital.\\nMSIM has a decentralised approach towards investment management, consisting of \\nindependent public- and private-markets investment teams and asset class platforms. This \\ndecentralised investment approach allows investment teams to tailor their approach to \\nsustainability, consistent with their fiduciary duty, using multiple factors including, but not \\nlimited to, the objectives of the product, asset class and investment time horizon, as well ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For example, MSIM’s GRA \\nteam works closely with the Firm’s Global Sustainability \\nOffice to design and develop long-term climate-related \\nscenarios as described in this Climate Report, to identify \\nand assess key climate-related risks and opportunities . \\nMore detail on climate-related risks and opportunities \\nis included in the Risk Management section of this \\nClimate Report.Remuneration\\nA primary objective in designing compensation \\nprogrammes for MSIM employees is to ensure that \\ncompensation incentives are aligned with our business \\nstrategy of driving performance and adding value for \\nclients, shareholders and other Firm employees.\\nFurther, the Firm has a Global Incentive Compensation \\nDiscretion (“GICD”) Policy. The GICD Policy requires \\nand directs compensation managers to consider only \\nlegitimate, business-related factors when exercising \\ndiscretion in determining incentive compensation. Such \\nfactors include adherence to Morgan Stanley’s core \\nvalues, conduct, disciplinary actions in the current \\nperformance year, risk management and risk outcomes. \\nThe GICD Policy also requires and directs compensation \\nmanagers to escalate circumstances that may warrant \\ncancellation or clawback of previously awarded \\ncompensation for further investigation. Compensation \\nmanagers are required to certify their compliance with \\nthe GICD Policy in advance of exercising discretion in \\ndetermining incentive compensation, and Morgan Stanley’s \\nHuman Resources coverage team works directly with \\ncompensation managers to ensure that they understand \\ntheir responsibilities.\\nWhere required by regulation, such as the EU SFDR,8 \\nthe UCITS Directive9 or MiFID II,10 MSIM’s local entities \\nhave adopted remuneration policies to promote sound \\nand effective risk management of sustainability risks, \\nincluding discouraging excessive risk-taking with respect \\nto sustainability risks. Risk is considered at every \\nstage of the compensation planning process, from the \\ninitial determination of the bonus pool to individual \\ncompensation decisions. \\n8 Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial \\nservices sector.\\n 9 Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions \\nrelating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities.\\n 10 Directive 2014/65/EU of the Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 of the \\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 collectively known as MiFID II.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In the short term, moderate rises in \\nglobal temperatures may marginally increase the frequency \\nand severity of these weather events, resulting in property \\ndamage to areas not prepared for weather events of \\nthis scope. \\nThe frequency of significant weather events may increase over \\ntime, heightening the overall risk in the medium- and long-\\nterm time horizons.\\nChronic\\nChronic physical risks are related to longer-term shifts \\nin ecosystems, geographic characteristics, sea levels and \\nbiodiversity. Over the short and medium term, there may be \\nrelatively low portfolio exposure to these chronic risks, as the \\nissues are typically long term in nature.\\nMSIM expects the risk level to its portfolios to be moderate in \\nthe long term, although it may be heightened if average global \\ntemperatures increase faster than anticipated. The real estate \\nsector may face higher chronic risk relative to other sectors, \\nas companies are expected to increase investment in physical \\ninfrastructure to account for the changes in geography \\nand climate.\\nTRANSITION RISKS\\nPolicy and Legal\\nWhile many governments are already setting emissions \\nreduction targets, there remain differing views across \\ncountries regarding the best approach and timeline. \\nAs a result, coordination on impactful climate action is \\nexpected to be unlikely in the short-term, limiting the \\noverall policy and legal risk. Sectors that rely heavily on \\nfossil fuels, such as energy, utilities or materials, may \\nface relatively higher risk, as they are more likely to be \\ndirectly impacted by new climate policy and regulation. \\nHowever, policymakers are expected to face mounting \\npressure from severe weather events over time, increasing \\nthe likelihood of a more coordinated global regulation of \\nemissions and carbon pricing. Policy and legal risk may \\nbecome progressively heightened over the medium- and \\nlong-term time horizons as a result.Technology\\nIn the short term, new low-carbon technology is expected \\nto remain expensive in relation to existing technologies. \\nUntil newer technologies become cost competitive, \\nthere may be limited risk that existing technology or \\ninfrastructure is replaced.\\nIn the medium term, new technology may become \\nmore cost competitive, creating a moderate risk that \\nexisting technology or infrastructure becomes obsolete. \\nCompanies are expected to start investing broadly in \\ndeveloping new low-carbon technologies.\\nOver the long term, technologies are expected to shift \\nfrom traditional fossil fuels to low-carbon alternatives. \\nCompanies that have not invested in updating their \\ntechnologies may face heightened risk from stranded \\nassets or asset write-downs.\\nMarket\\nIn the short term, market risk is expected to be moderate, \\nas increased costs in raw materials due to inflation and \\ngeopolitical risks may accelerate changes in consumer \\npreferences. Over time, fossil fuels are expected to \\nbecome more expensive, and companies that have no \\nviable alternative energy sources may face heightened risk \\nas they experience asset write-downs.\\nReputation\\nIn the short term, the reputation of companies may \\nbe partially based on their progress toward emissions \\nreduction, but the overall risk is expected to be limited. \\nProgressively more emphasis may be placed on this \\nprogress over the medium and long term, heightening the \\nreputational risk to companies over these time horizons.\\nDeliver Global Depth and Breadth in \\nSustainable Investing Expertise \\nMSIM’s investment teams incorporate the assessment \\nof material ESG risks and opportunities into investment \\ndecision-making processes, as appropriate and consistent \\nwith their fiduciary duties, and according to investment \\nteams’ particular investment strategies.

For \\nprivate markets, ESG risks or opportunities may be raised \\nas part of the relevant Investment Committee process \\nand evaluated in coordination with Morgan Stanley’s \\nESRM group.15We recognise that the impact of sustainability factors on \\nour investments and assets and the tools and best practices \\nfor assessing those impacts are rapidly evolving. We have \\nseveral processes in place designed to ensure that we are \\nwell positioned as a business to address climate-related risks \\nand opportunities related to our investment management \\nactivities as appropriate, including:\\n\\t\\x84Ongoing monitoring and tracking of global ESG legal and \\nregulatory developments  by the MSIM Sustainability \\nteam and the Compliance department, which supports \\nMSIM’s compliance with these requirements.\\n\\t\\x84Internal assurance processes  that assess compliance \\nwith ESG external laws and regulations  and ongoing \\nwork with MSIM Legal and Compliance and various \\nexternal consultants to monitor the legal and regulatory \\nlandscape and prepare road maps for disclosures, as well \\nas continual improvement.\\n\\t\\x84Ongoing training : topical training and knowledge-sharing \\nis provided periodically to investment teams and relevant \\nstakeholders on global sustainability regulations and \\nframeworks, client ESG/stewardship requirements and \\ninterests, sustainable investing and engagement trends \\nand best practices, and mitigation of greenwashing risks.\\nMSIM Engagement Framework\\nAs active investors and active owners, we have a duty to \\nbe good stewards of our clients’ capital. We seek to fulfil \\nthis duty by engaging with selected companies in which we \\ninvest, and by exercising our proxy voting and other rights \\nas shareholders. These stewardship activities give us the \\nopportunity to help guide companies in which we invest \\ntoward better ESG practices, which we believe could \\ncontribute to attractive returns for our clients over the \\nlong term.\\nStewardship and engagement efforts at MSIM are led by \\ninvestment teams with engagement objectives prioritised \\ndepending on asset class, geography, investment style  \\nand strategy. \\nAlthough MSIM does not have centralised investment \\nbeliefs across asset classes and strategies, there are \\n15 The Firm’s Environmental and Social Risk Management Group (“ESRM”) provides internal subject matter expertise to MSIM’s private markets teams on \\nenvironmental and social risk, conducts due diligence on relevant transactions, engages with stakeholders, and monitors emerging risks and developments in \\npartnership with the Firm’s business units, Global Sustainability Office and other relevant control functions.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Climate scenarios are \\na set of plausible futures for the operating context of the \\nbusiness, and are not predictions about any single “most \\nlikely” future. MSIM has scenario analysis capabilities \\nacross different layers of the business performed at \\nthe Firm, MSIM and product level, as part of our risk \\nmanagement function, which is independent from the \\ninvestment teams.17 \\nGRA performs scenario analysis to help assess the \\npotential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities \\non investments, and to identify vulnerabilities over the \\nassessed time horizon from a risk perspective. Specifically, \\nGRA has the capability to conduct forward-looking \\nscenario analysis to centrally monitor climate risk of \\ncertain portfolios across different asset classes in order to \\nmeasure the financial impact of climate change. Currently, \\nand with respect to the reporting period, the strength of \\nGRA’s capabilities is in quantifying the potential impact of \\ntransition risks and opportunities on our public portfolios.\\nA number of short-, medium- and long-term physical risks \\nhave been identified that could impact our aggregated \\ninvestment portfolio as noted previously. However, we \\ndo not currently incorporate these risks into scenario \\nanalysis processes. It is up to investment teams to choose \\nwhether and how to assess the physical risk exposure to \\ntheir portfolios. Some investments may do this, while \\nothers may not, depending on the financial products and \\nthe team’s ESG approach. We are seeking to advance \\nour physical risk methodologies to assess and monitor \\nexposure. Firm Risk Management continues to work with \\nthe Global Sustainability Office to advance physical risk \\nmethodologies and proprietary modelling capabilities over \\ntime to provide a consolidated view.Results are shared with investment teams and monitored \\nfor changes over time by GRA to ensure that climate-\\nrelated risks are being appropriately identified, tracked \\nand managed.\\nClimate Scenario Analysis Methodology\\nThe Firm has developed long-term climate scenario \\nnarratives focusing on several proprietary scenarios \\nand simulated impacts on numerous macroeconomic \\nindicators out to 2050. GRA has used three scenarios that \\nare aligned to narratives by the Network for Greening \\nthe Financial System (“NGFS”). These scenarios have \\nbeen applied to the quantitative analysis performed over \\nseveral, but not all, of MSIM products. This has been \\ndeveloped and delivered independently of the investment \\nteams. The scenarios are reflected below:\\nThese scenario outputs have been derived from a \\nsuite of models comprising an Integrated Assessment \\nModel, which is a recommended technique by certain \\nindustry standard bodies, as well as macroeconomic and \\nindustrial models.\\nThe Integrated Assessment Model is then linked to more \\ngranular models to generate macro-financial and sector \\noutputs across the different scenarios. These outputs \\ninclude market variables, commodity prices, regional GDP, \\nsector revenues and others. These outputs are used by \\nGRA as inputs for quantifying the market shocks. These \\nshocks are then constructed in risk management systems \\nin order to calculate the stress Profit and Loss returns at \\nthe product and benchmark levels. \\nGRA uses these scenarios and runs product-level \\nassessments for products across the business. Centrally, \\nthe team assesses prospective portfolio returns and \\ncompares them to market benchmarks to seek to identify \\nany potential areas to investigate further. \\n17 For more information on the Firm analysis, see the Morgan Stanley  Firm-level ESG disclosures .

Global temperature \\nrise is limited to 2°C to 2.5°C through fragmented climate action lacking coordination globally. Countries and businesses choose to \\nfocus on self-reliance and protectionism to mitigate risks from climate, pandemics and geopolitical disruption. There is a significant \\ndivergence in carbon prices globally as a result. Economies are localised with GDP and population growth rates varying by region. \\nIncome gaps also continue to widen. While there are domestic investments in clean technology and infrastructure, this progress is also \\naccompanied by green tech export restrictions. This situation further exacerbates the significant difference in clean technology and \\ncosts by region. While there are some ambitious and meaningful climate efforts, global success is ultimately hampered by division and \\nmisalignment between countries.\\nPRIORITISING RECOVERY, NOT CLIMATE\\nPrioritising recovery (“ hothouse world ”) — Focus on growth results in a shift away from curtailing emissions with climate regulations \\nbeing relaxed, leading to significant physical and economic impacts due to climate change.\\nIn this scenario, policymakers take insufficient climate action to reduce global total CO2 emissions. Instead, they prioritise economic \\ngrowth, and global temperature rise climbs to 3°C to 4°C. There are country-specific carbon prices, and low tariffs/trade barriers \\nare in place in order to promote global commerce. There is heightened investment in technology, and money continues to flow into \\ntraditional fossil fuel exploration and production industries as well. Economic growth is high in the short term as a result, but with \\npotentially higher costs in the medium- to long-term time horizons.Scenario Narratives\\nClimate Scenario Analysis Output\\nThe scenario narratives described above seek to enable \\nimpacts to be simulated across a number of indicators out \\nto 2050.

While \\nthere may be some headwinds from higher carbon prices \\nand changing consumer preferences, companies are \\nexpected to benefit over time.\\nPrioritising Recovery, Not Climate\\nIMPACT OF TRANSITION SUMMARY\\nIn the short term, there is an increase in the economic \\ngrowth rate, as policymakers focus only on the market \\nrecovery from COVID-19. Technology is the primary driver \\nof the economy, and money continues to flow into this \\nsector. Carbon prices remain relatively low, so there are \\nfewer dislocations across sectors compared to the other \\nscenarios. Over time, the global economy continues to \\noutperform based on the growth-above-all approach of \\npolicymakers. As mentioned, this assessment does not \\nincorporate the full spectrum of potential damages from \\nphysical risk.\\nENERGY SECTOR\\nThe energy sector is not expected to face heightened \\ntransition risk in the “prioritising recovery, not climate” \\nscenario. Money will continue to be invested in the \\nexploration and production activities of traditional oil and \\ngas companies.\\nMATERIALS SECTOR\\nThe materials sector is not expected to face heightened \\nrisk in this scenario, as companies may continue to benefit \\nfrom relatively low carbon prices.\\nFINANCIALS SECTOR\\nAs policymakers continue to focus on economic growth, the \\nfinancial sector is expected to face limited risk in this scenario. \\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR\\nThe information technology sector is expected to play a \\nkey role in driving economic growth in this scenario. New investments may continue to flow into the space with \\ntechnological developments fueling higher productivity.\\nUTILITIES SECTOR\\nThe utilities sector is not expected to face heightened \\ntransition risk in this scenario, as the transition from gas to \\nelectric utilities may be slow-moving. Carbon prices may \\nalso continue to remain relatively low. Rate affordability \\nmay be strained by reliance on legacy fossil assets.\\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY\\nAlthough money may continue to flow into traditional oil \\nand gas exploration and production companies, moderate \\ninvestment in renewable energy is also expected in this \\nscenario. The pace of development for new renewable \\nenergy technology will not be as fast as in the other two \\nscenarios, but the industry may still be a driver of growth \\nas companies focus on climate adaptation.\\nREAL ESTATE SECTOR\\nWhile real estate may benefit from the higher growth \\nrates in this scenario over the short term, the sector is \\nexpected to face heightened physical risks from the lack of \\nclimate action in the long term.\\nTRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY\\nThe transportation industry is not expected to experience \\nthe same benefits from new investments in electric \\nvehicles and infrastructure as in the other two scenarios. \\nCompanies, which are laggards in the energy transition, \\nmay be given a chance to catch up.\\nTAKEAWAYS FROM MSIM CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\\nClimate scenario analysis will continue to inform our risk \\nmeasurement and management processes.

Financial institutions that commit to measuring and \\ndisclosing the emissions associated with their financial activities in line wi th the PCAF Standard must fulfill \\nthese requirements when disclosing their emissions publicly.  \\nTo best support and evaluate if signatories report their financed emissions against PCAF’s reporting \\nrequirements, PCAF is providing this “PCAF disclosure checklist”. This checklist and PCAF’s disclosure \\nprocess  (Annex 1) , is a way for signatories to substantiate their PCAF alignment and identify potential areas \\nfor additional enhancements to their disclosures. Further, this checklist aims to provide a holistic way to \\nstandardize and improve the quality of PCAF disclosures  over time.  \\nConfidentiality : Information provided in this disclosure checklis t and its review by the PCAF Secretariat, \\nincluding any related communication s from the PCAF Secretariat , shall be deemed confidential and will only \\nbe accessible b y PCAF Secretaria t staff . Member s of PCAF Secretaria t staff are no t employed by or \\nassociated with any financial institution or other organization that compete s with PCAF members; PCAF \\nSecretariat staff shall not use any information submitted in furtherance of any commercia l purpose or activity \\nor disclose the information to any person not associated with the PCAF Secretariat. PCAF Secretaria t staff \\nshall delete or destroy any information provided following completion of its review.  \\nNotwithstanding the confidentiality commitment above, the following shall not be subject to such \\nconfidentiality: (a)  information that is or will be generally known to the public (provided that such information \\ndoes not result from PCAF’s unauthorized disclosure to the public); or (b) information subject to disclosure \\nper mutual written agreement.

As per the disclosure process (Annex 1), the \\ntechnical assistance team will review and approve your disclosure checklist before your final \\ndisclosure will be featured on the PCAF website – no draft disclosure or disclosure checklist will be \\nmade public .  \\nFor a submitted disclosure checklist to meet the minimum requirements  for publication on the PCAF \\nwebsite : \\n•All checklist questions  are to be answered with “ Yes” or “ No”\\n•Questions on “Reporting Requirements ” for the categories\\n−General Disclosure Criteria ,\\n−Coverage ,\\n−Absolute Emissions ,\\n−Avoided Emissions and Emission Removals , and\\n−Recalculation and Significance Threshold\\nthat were answered with “No”,  are complemented with a sufficient justification  for the deviation \\nfrom the standard  in the checklist . This explanation is ideally also included in the public disclosure . \\n•“Reporting Recommendations ” – if answered with “No” – may be excluded, however, it is\\nrecommended  to provide justification.\\n•In the case that a disclosure point is non -applicable, the signatory should tick “No” and write “non -\\napplicable”  in the comment box.\\nIdeally, users of this checklist indicate, per question, the relevant pages of the report in which the financed \\nemissions disclosure can be found if it forms part of a bigger report.  \\nDisclosure checklists that deviate from the Standard will receive feedback for revision, which should be \\nimplemented before re -submission and Secretariat publication on the PCAF website .  \\nThe PCAF Secretariat reserves the right to decide when the minimum requirements have not been met.  \\nThis checklist focuses only on the minimum requirements set by the Standard. However, reporting \\ninstitutions  are encouraged  to go beyond these requirements where possible.

Created\\nin 2015 by Dutch financial institutions (FIs), PCAF extended to North America in 2018 and scaled \\nup globally in 2019. The globalization of PCAF enables FIs worldwide to consistently measure and \\ndisclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of their financial activities. \\nAs an industry-led partnership, PCAF is governed by a Steering Committee which consists of ABN \\nAMRO, Amalgamated Bank, ASN Bank, the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, Morgan Stanley, \\nNMB Bank, Triodos Bank, and a representative from the United Nations (UN)-convened Net-\\nZero Asset Owner Alliance. At the time of publishing this document, more than 300 banks and \\ninvestors participate in PCAF.1  \\nResponding to industry demand for a global, standardized GHG accounting and reporting \\napproach, PCAF developed the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial \\nIndustry, focusing on measuring and reporting financed emissions. Published in November 2020, \\nthe standard provides detailed methodological guidance to measure and disclose GHG emissions \\nassociated with six asset classes: listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted \\nequity, project finance, commercial real estate, mortgages, and motor vehicle loans.\\nSince then, banks and investors have asked to expand the standard with more methods, also \\ncovering other activities of the financial industry. From 2021 onwards, PCAF started the work on \\nthree parts under the umbrella of the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the \\nFinancial Industry:\\n• Part A: update of the first version standard on measuring and reporting financed emissions, \\nby adding a method for sovereign debt and guidance to account for emission removals \\n(“Financed Emissions Standard – second version”)\\n• Part B: development of a standard for measuring and reporting the GHG emissions \\nassociated to the capital market facilitation activities (“Facilitated Emissions Standard”)\\n• Part C: development of a standard for measuring and reporting the GHG emissions \\nassociated to re/insurance underwriting (“Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard”)\\n1 The full list of PCAF participants can be found at: https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/financial-institutions-taking-\\naction#overview-of-institutions', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To limit global warming \\nto 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, all sectors of society need to decarbonize and collectively \\nreach net-zero emissions by 2050. The financial sector can help facilitate the transition in line \\nwith a 1.5°C scenario by directing capital to support decarbonization. \\nTo trigger changes in capital flows and signals for all sectors, the financial industry must \\nacknowledge and endorse the need for as well as the pace of decarbonization. The financial \\nindustry should begin by better understanding the climate risks to their portfolio and the \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (or climate impact) associated with their loans and investments. \\nMeasuring financed emissions is crucial in providing this understanding. If financial institutions \\nknow the emissions financed by loans and investments, they can better identify and manage \\nrisks, navigate emission reduction goals, act to reduce their portfolio climate impact, and \\ndisclose progress. This understanding then triggers internal discussions and engagements with \\nstakeholders to identify concrete actions that help lower financed emissions.\\nThe role of PCAF and GHG emissions accounting in reporting,  \\nmanaging risks and opportunities, and aligning financial flows with  \\nthe Paris Agreement\\nPrior to the establishment of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), financial \\ninstitutions used different approaches and accounting methodologies to measure financed \\nemissions and opted for various reporting metrics, which led to inconsistent assessments of the \\nindustry’s climate impact. This lack of standardization hampered transparency, comparability, and \\naccountability of the financial sector. \\nTherefore, in 2019 banks, investors, and fund managers from five continents partnered to create \\nthe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).3 Committed to the measurement \\nand disclosure of the absolute GHG emissions of their portfolios (financed emissions), this \\nindustry-led initiative has rapidly expanded in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, \\nand Asia Pacific.4 PCAF aims to standardize the way financial institutions measure and disclose \\nfinanced emissions and increase the number of financial institutions that commit to measuring \\nand disclosing financed emissions. Standardization increases transparency, comparability, and \\naccountability of the financial sector.\\nMeasuring financed emissions is critical for financial institutions that want to improve their \\nclimate reporting. Measuring and transparently reporting financed emissions helps financial \\ninstitutions and their stakeholders understand the climate impact of the organization’s lending \\nand investment activities. \\n2 (New Climate Institute and Climate Analytics, 2020)\\n3 More information about PCAF is found at: https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/\\n4 A full list of PCAF participants is found at:  \\nhttps://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/financial-institutions-taking-action#overview-of-institutions', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This information is helpful to develop \\nrisk management strategies and to identify business opportunities that could support risk \\nmanagement and the transition to a low carbon economy. \\nLastly, accounting for financed emissions is an important part of the process that banks and \\ninvestors take when aligning their lending and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris \\nAgreement.

The emissions measured are the seven gases mandated under the Kyoto Protocol and are to \\nbe included in national inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \\nChange (UNFCCC): carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons \\n(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). For ease \\nof accounting, these gases are usually converted to and expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents \\n(CO2e).\\nGHG accounting is most commonly used by governments, corporations, and other entities to \\nmeasure the direct and indirect emissions that occur throughout their value chains as a result \\nof organizational and business activities. According to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting \\nand Reporting Standard,9 direct emissions are generated by sources owned or controlled by the \\nreporting company. Indirect emissions occur as a consequence of the operations of the reporting \\ncompany but that are generated by sources owned or controlled by another company.\\nDirect and indirect emissions are further categorized by scope and distinguished according to the \\nsource of the emissions and the activity in an organization’s value chain in which the emissions \\noccur. The three scopes defined by the GHG Protocol—scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3—are briefly \\ndescribed below and are illustrated in Figure 2 1. \\n• Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions that occur from sources owned or controlled by the \\nreporting company, i.e., emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, \\nvehicles, etc.\\n• Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, \\nsteam, heating, or cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 2 emissions \\nphysically occur at the facility where the electricity, steam, heating, or cooling is generated.\\n• Scope 3: All other indirect GHG emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value \\nchain of the reporting company. Scope 3 can be broken down into upstream emissions and \\ndownstream emissions. Upstream emissions include all emissions that occur in the life \\ncycle of a material/product/service up to the point of sale by the producer, such as from \\nthe production or extraction of purchased materials.10 Downstream emissions include all \\nemissions that occur as a consequence of the distribution, storage, use, and end-of-life \\ntreatment of the organization’s products or services. \\nThe GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard11 \\ncategorizes scope 3 emissions into 15 categories, which are listed in Figure 2-1.

GHG accounting is a necessary step for organizations to \\nbetter manage their emissions and align with the Paris Agreement. For a financial institution, \\nscope 3 category 15 emissions, i.e., financed emissions, are often the most significant part of \\nits GHG emissions inventory. As a result, special consideration must be made regarding how \\nthese emissions are measured. The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard aims to \\nprovide a standardized approach to account for financed emissions, ensuring that the approach \\nused by financial institutions is robust, transparent, and comparable over time and across asset \\nclasses. This is crucial because measuring financed emissions is an important step financial \\ninstitutions take to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, set targets in line with the Paris \\nAgreement, and develop effective strategies to support the decarbonization of society.\\nAs shown in Figure 1-1, measuring financed emissions is central to activities that enable \\nfinancial institutions to embed climate action throughout their lending and investment activities. \\nReporting financed emissions is important for showing stakeholders the climate impact of a \\nfinancial institution’s activities. Furthermore, the act of making a public disclosure shows that the \\norganization holds itself accountable for these impacts. \\nFinanced emissions are a necessary input for climate scenario analysis.

Financed emissions can be measured as amounts of GHGs \\ngenerated, avoided, or removed by an institution. The volume of GHG emissions emitted and \\nfinanced by an institution is commonly referred to as its generated emissions. To limit climate \\nchange and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, financiers must actively seek out actions that \\nreduce generated emissions in absolute terms, i.e., absolute emissions.14\\nNot all loans and investments result in GHG emissions. Some may result in mitigating activities. \\nFor instance, project-specific loans and investments in the forestry and land use sector, direct \\nair carbon capture and storage, or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage can result in CO2 \\nbeing sequestered or removed from the atmosphere and stored in solid or liquid form, removing \\nits harmful global warming effect. Investments in afforestation projects can directly result in newly \\nplanted trees absorbing CO2 from the air. The volume of CO2 absorbed is considered an emission \\nremoval that can also be quantified and reported, demonstrating a type of positive contribution \\ntoward decarbonization. \\nSimilarly, project-specific loans and investments in renewable energy projects can result in \\nemissions being avoided as they displace the emissions that would have otherwise occurred \\nwithout the project’s implementation. These emissions are referred to as avoided emissions and \\nreporting them is a way to demonstrate a quantifiable positive contribution to decarbonization. \\nFor the financial sector, which finances projects that lead to avoided emissions, quantifying this \\neffect is relevant.\\nReporting on emission removals and avoided emissions shall always be done separately from that \\nof the financial institution’s scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG inventories.\\nGHG accounting enables benchmarking\\nMeasuring financed emissions in absolute terms, i.e., absolute emissions, provides financial \\ninstitutions with the necessary baseline for climate action to align with the Paris Agreement. \\nHowever, normalized data is often useful for banks and investors to manage climate transition \\nrisk, set targets, or create new products. Normalizing the data means translating the absolute \\nfinanced emissions to an emission intensity metric (emissions per a specific unit).

Since \\nthe economic crisis of 2007-2009, a wide range of stakeholders has demanded more transparency \\naround how their money is invested. In response to demand and the consensus that climate \\nchange poses a considerable threat to the global economy, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) \\nlaunched the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The remit \\nof the TCFD was to develop recommendations for “consistent, comparable, reliable, clear and \\nefficient climate-related disclosures by companies.”20 The TCFD framework21 has expanded since \\nthe first recommendations were launched in 2017 to be the global guidance on how companies \\nshould disclose their climate-related risks and opportunities. At the time of the publication of \\nthis edition of the Financed Emissions Standard, TCFD-recommended disclosures are voluntary.22 \\nHowever, with strong backing from the central banks, the Supervisors Network for Greening \\nthe Financial System, and the industry itself, companies will likely be faced with new regulatory \\nrequirements in this arena.\\n20 More information about FSB can be found at:  \\nhttps://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/policy-development/additional-policy-areas/climate-related-financial-disclosures/\\n21 (TCFD, 2017)\\n22 Except in New Zealand, where the government introduced mandatory TCFD disclosures in September 2020:  \\nhttps://bit.ly/2TWUxwm.

Such lending and investment activities could suffer setbacks resulting from the \\nintroduction of carbon prices and policies and regulations that are strict on fossil fuels.\\nUnderstanding the exposure to risk is at the heart of TCFD’s mission.

Steering decarbonization: from GHG accounting to setting science-based \\ntargets\\nFinancial institutions that decide to set science-based targets using SBTi’s Sectoral \\nDecarbonization Approach (SDA) need to measure their financed emissions to identify the \\nbaseline from which targets would be established and to measure progress against the \\ntargets.\\nThe SBTi framework for the financial sector enables financial institutions to align lending \\nand investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Financial institutions that \\nset science-based targets and work toward attaining those targets act on opportunities to \\nfinance the net-zero emission transition. \\nThe SDA is a science-based target setting method that involves setting emissions-based \\ntargets, in which GHG accounting is a fundamental step of the process. The asset classes \\ncovered in the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard match the four asset classes \\nincluded in the SBT framework.\\nFigure 3-4.

To track progress \\nagainst the emission-based target, financial institutions must therefore measure and \\ndisclose their financed emissions annually. \\nDetermining sector-specific emission intensity at the asset class or sector level is the \\nstarting point to apply the SDA for target setting. Sector-specific emission intensity refers \\nto financed emissions per unit of activity data, e.g., kgCO2e/m2, gCO2e/kWh, tonCO2e/tonne \\ncement.

As explained in Box 4, this means that emissions \\nfrom financial institutions’ loans and investments (without operational or financial control42) \\nwill be reported under their scope 3 category 15 (investments) emissions, as defined by the \\nGHG Protocol Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.43 This requirement \\neliminates inconsistencies in accounting that could arise from using the equity share approach, \\nwhich would require scope 1 and 2 emissions from all equity investments to be reported under the \\nfinancial institution’s scope 1 and 2 emissions (according to its share of equity in the operation). \\nAs a result, the Financed Emissions Standard provides a harmonized approach that can be \\nused by financial institutions wishing to account for and disclose their scope 3 category 15 \\n(investments) emissions (otherwise known as their financed emissions), and these are the sole \\nfocus of this Financed Emissions Standard. Financial institutions following the Financed Emissions \\nStandard are required to report all financed emissions under scope 3 category 15 and disclose \\nand justify any exclusions. \\n40 (WRI and WBCSD, 2004)\\n41 (WRI and WBCSD, 2004)\\n42 Only in cases that a financial institution has control (operational or financial, depending on the approach chosen) over the \\noperations of the borrower, or investee will 100% of their emissions be included within the organizational boundaries of the \\nfinancial institution. As a result, these emissions will be included under the scope 1 and 2 emissions of the financial institution. \\nThis can occur when a financial institution holds a controlling equity share in the investee. In general, however, most of the \\nfinancial sector’s loans and investments are not held to gain control over their borrower or investee.\\n43 (WRI and WBCSD, 2011)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Why the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard requires financial \\ninstitutions to measure and report financed emissions using the operational or financial \\ncontrol approach\\nThe GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard44 presents three \\nconsolidation approaches when preparing GHG emission inventories: the equity share \\napproach, the financial control approach, and the operational control approach. These \\nconsolidation approaches are intended to define the organizational boundaries of the \\ncompany for the purposes of accounting and reporting GHG emissions. The selection of one \\nof these approaches affects which activities in the company’s value chain are categorized \\nas direct emissions (i.e., scope 1 emissions) and indirect emissions (i.e., scope 2 and scope 3 \\nemissions).\\nUnder the equity share approach, an organization accounts for GHG emissions from \\noperations according to its share of equity—or ownership—in the operation. So, holding a \\n15% equity share in another organization would require including 15% of its emissions across \\nall its emission scopes: scope 1, 2, and 3.\\nAlternatively, an organization can report using the control approach, whereby the company \\nreports 100% of the GHG emissions over which it has control as if these emissions were \\nits own (i.e., 100% of direct emissions are reported under scope 1 and 100% of indirect \\nemissions are reported under scope 2 or 3, respectively). Where the company owns an \\ninterest but does not have control, it does not account for GHG emissions from operations \\nas part of its scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, emissions from such operations will be \\nreported under scope 3 emissions according to its relative share of ownership.45\\nBox continues on next page �>\\n44 (WRI and WBCSD, 2004)\\n45 In practice, using a control approach means that when a company has control over an operation 100% of the scope 1 and 2 \\nemissions of this operation are also reported under the companies’ scope 1 and 2 footprint.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Using the \\noperational control approach, an organization shall account for 100% of emissions from \\noperations over which it or one of its subsidiaries has control and the authority to introduce \\nand implement operational policies. In most cases, whether an operation is controlled by \\nthe company or not does not differ between the financial control or operational control \\napproach. \\nThe consolidation approach used by a financial institution has a significant impact on how \\nit accounts for its financed emissions.

The attribution factor is defined as the share of total annual GHG emissions of the \\nborrower or investee that is allocated to the loan(s) or investment(s).\\n3. 3.

This is different from some accounting definitions of book value of debt, which exclude some elements like non-interest-\\nbearing debt (also see next footnote on precautionary principle). \\n61 This is the standard definition of EVIC as provided by the EU TEG.

In reality, specific elements of EVIC might not be readily available because data providers are still working on \\naligning their data with this definition. For cases where data is missing, the EU TEG (pg. 16 in its handbook of climate-related \\nbenchmarks) recommends conducting corporate GHG data estimations based on the UN’s (1992) precautionary principle: “If in \\ndoubt, err on the side of the planet not the side of the company.” Following this precautionary approach for EVIC calculations, \\nfinancial institutions can decide to exclude elements of the EVIC (e.g., minority interests or certain elements of the book value of \\ndebt) as this would lead to a slightly lower EVIC and higher attribution of financed emissions to their own outstanding amount. \\nThese slight deviations from the standard EVIC definition are allowed as long as: (1) they are in line with this precautionary \\nprinciple, and (2) the basis of the EVIC definition still includes the market value of equity (market capitalization) plus the total \\nbook value of debt of any given company.\\n62  (EU Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, 2019)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Rationale for EVIC as denominator in the attribution factor\\nAs described in subchapter 4.2 of the Standard, PCAF applies the same general attribution \\nprinciples across all asset classes even though the actual equations and underlying \\n(financial) data sources might differ per asset class. This principle defines that the \\nattribution factor for all asset classes is calculated by determining the attribution factor \\nof the outstanding amount of a financial institution over the total equity and debt of the \\ncompany, project, property, etc. in which the financial institution is invested. Applying this \\nprinciple means that, for the attribution of listed companies, a metric needed to be defined \\nthat includes both the equity and debt of a listed company.\\nEVIC was selected as the attribution metric for listed equity and corporate bonds because it:\\n• Includes both equity and debt in line with PCAF attribution principles and other asset \\nclasses, ensuring alignment with similar asset classes (e.g., business loans).\\n• Is a common metric in the financial sector of a company’s total value and is expected \\nto gain more dominance because of its adoption by the EU TEG and the benchmark \\nregulation.\\n• Is based on company data (market value of equity and total book value of debt), \\nwhich is generally available to financial institutions and data providers. The availability \\nof this data is expected to be further improved due to the EU climate benchmarks \\nregulation, which will stimulate data providers to collect EVIC data.\\n• Includes market valuation of equity, which is the most common approach in the \\nfinancial sector to determine company ownership.\\n• Avoids issues with negative enterprise values due to the inclusion of cash (not \\ndeducting cash as in the regular enterprise value definition) as well as issues with \\nattributing more than 100% of a company’s emissions to financial institutions.\\nThe simplified example below highlights how EVIC ensures 100% attribution of company \\nemissions by not deducting cash.\\n            \\n           Example Company: Equity = 50, Debt = 50, Cash = 20\\nApproaches Enterprise \\nvalueAttribution to \\nequityAttribution to \\ndebtTotal\\nEV excl. cash \\n(standard)50 + 50 - 20 = 80 50/80 = 63% 50/80 = 63% > 100%\\nEV incl. cash 50 + 50 = 100 50 / 100 = 50% 50 / 100 = 50% 100%\\nExceptions\\nIf a financial institution only invests in equity and undertakes GHG accounting from a risk perspective, \\nemissions could also be attributed to the total market capitalization (market value of a company’s \\noutstanding shares) of the company. Please note, however, that the Financed Emissions Standard is \\naiming to standardize and harmonize GHG accounting across financial institutions and has a clear \\npreference for using EVIC.

In \\na bull market where valuation would increase, all else kept equal (GHG emissions and ownership \\nunchanged), the denominator would increase and as a result the economic emission intensity \\nwould decrease. Under the influence of these fluctuations, an objective to reduce the economic \\nemission intensity by a certain percentage becomes a moving target. This undermines the \\nutility of the metric to make comparisons from one time period to the next.\\nTo address this limitation regarding the economic emission intensity, the EU TEG and EU \\nregulation on benchmarks suggest that asset owners/managers correct EVIC over time by \\napplying an inflation correction. Building on the EU inflation correction, PCAF recommends that \\nasset owners/managers adjust the economic emission intensity with the following adjustment \\nfactor. The adjustment factor should be calculated as:  \\nADJb,T /equal.capi∑\\n(With b = base year and T = current year and WT = benchmarks weights at time T)EVICb\\nEVICTwT × \\nThere are two options for adjusting the economic emission intensity (backward or current): \\n1. The economic emission intensity can be adjusted in the base year (backward). Benefits \\nof adjusting the base year are that current reported carbon figures remain unadjusted. \\nMoreover, EVIC inflation correction applied to the baseline can be combined with other \\nadjustments that may be required, for example for data improvements or a changing \\nuniverse composition.  \\nTo calculate adjusted economic emission intensity in the base year (b):\\nEconomic emission intensityadjusted (b)=Economic emission intensity (b) × ADJb,T\\n2. The economic emission intensity can also be adjusted for the current reporting year. \\nBenefits of adjusting the current year are intuitiveness for annual reporting, where the \\nfocus is usually on the metrics associated with the current year.

Outstanding amount (numerator): This is the actual outstanding loan amount. \\na For business loans, this is defined as the value of the debt that the borrower owes to \\nthe lender (i.e., disbursed debt minus any repayments). It will be adjusted annually to \\nreflect the correct exposure, resulting in the attribution to decline to 0 at the end of \\nthe lifetime of the loan (i.e., when it is fully repaid). \\nb For unlisted equity (i.e., equity investments in private companies), the outstanding \\namount is the outstanding value of equity that the financial institution holds in the \\nprivate company. It is calculated by multiplying the relative share of the financial \\ninstitution in the respective investee89 by the total equity of the respective investee \\naccording to its balance sheet.

No deductions of cash or cash equivalents are made to avoid the \\npossibility of negative enterprise values.94 \\n90 In cases where the total company equity value according to the client’s balance sheet is negative, the financial institution shall set \\ntotal equity to 0; this means that all emissions are attributed to debt only, while no emissions are attributed to equity investments. \\nSuch cases can happen when the retained earnings are negative while at the same time being higher than the other equity \\ncomponents on the balance sheet of the client—e.g., this often holds for startups that have high negative profits during their first \\nyears of operation. By this approach,  or those companies that are doing well (i.e., they have high retained earnings), financial \\ninstitutions attribute more emissions to equity providers; for those companies doing poorly (i.e., they have high retained losses), \\nfinancial institutions attribute more emissions to debt providers. This is in line with the attribution factor rationale for listed \\ncompanies, where the equity part of EVIC (i.e., market capitalization) also implicitly reflects retained earnings and losses (e.g., if \\nretained earnings increase, the share price and thus the market capitalization generally also increase).\\n91 Total debt includes both current and long-term debt on the balance sheet. \\n92 If total debt or total equity cannot be obtained from a client’s balance sheet for whatever reason (e.g., for some it might be difficult \\nto obtain these values), financial institutions are allowed to fall back to the total balance sheet value (i.e., the sum of total equity \\nand liabilities, which is equal to the client’s total assets) with the intention of improving this data quality in the future.\\n93 In its EVIC definition, the EU TEG refers to “the book values of total debt,” including all debt as listed on the company balance \\nsheet. This is different from some accounting definitions of book value of debt, which exclude some elements like non-interest-\\nbearing debt (also see next footnote on precautionary principle). \\n94 This is the standard definition of EVIC as provided by the EU TEG. For consistency reasons, PCAF decided to align with this \\ndefinition to ensure maximum alignment on metrics in the market, which also enables data providers to collect data in a \\nconsistent way. In reality, specific elements of EVIC might not be readily available because data providers are still working on \\naligning their data with this definition. For cases where data is missing, the EU TEG (pg. 16 in its handbook of climate-related \\nbenchmarks) recommends conducting corporate GHG data estimations based on the UN’s (1992) precautionary principle: “If in \\ndoubt, err on the side of the planet not the side of the company.” Following this precautionary approach for EVIC calculations, \\nfinancial institutions can decide to exclude elements of the EVIC (e.g., minority interests or certain elements of the book value of \\ndebt) as this would lead to a slightly lower EVIC and higher attribution of financed emissions to their own outstanding amount. \\nThese slight deviations from the standard EVIC definition are allowed as long as they are: (1) in line with this precautionary \\nprinciple, and (2) the basis of the EVIC definition still includes the market value of equity (market capitalization) plus the total \\nbook value of debt of any given company.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

One mitigating factor is that using borrower- or investee-specific \\nemission data could improve the accuracy of the region- or sector-specific average data if the \\nreporting financial institution had enough borrower- or investee-specific data points relative to \\nthe size of the portfolio in a given sector. For example, if a majority of the borrowers in a lender’s \\ntextile manufacturing loan portfolio provide specific emissions data, these averages could be \\napplied (instead of industrywide sector averages) to the remainder of the borrowers in the sector \\nthat did not provide specific emissions data.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Under the influence of this \\nfluctuation, an objective to reduce relative financed emissions (also referred to as emission \\nintensities) by a certain percentage becomes a moving target. Using normalized assets under \\nmanagement may help overcome this, as prices are held constant over the target period.

In addition, corrections could theoretically be applied to many other variables (like \\nexchange rates, inflation, emerging versus emerging markets, etc.), further reducing comparability. \\nFor that reason, PCAF requires all financial institutions to report their uncorrected absolute \\nemissions as a minimum. Corrected results may optionally be reported separately. If the financial \\ninstitution decides to apply such adjustments, they should be made transparent.

In the case of debt, the outstanding amount is defined as the value of the debt the borrower \\nowes to the lender (i.e., disbursed debt minus any repayments119). In the case of equity, the outstanding \\namount is the outstanding value of equity the financial institution holds in the project. It is calculated \\nby multiplying the relative share of the financial institution in the respective project120 by the total \\nequity of the respective project according to its balance sheet.

The emissions data should be estimated using \\nan appropriate calculation methodology or tool with verified emission factors expressed \\nper physical activity (e.g., tCO2e/MWh) issued or approved by a credible independent body \\nsuch as the International Energy Agency (IEA).\\n• Option 3: economic activity-based emissions, where emissions are estimated based on \\neconomic activity data collected from the project (e.g., revenue or assets). The emissions \\ndata should be estimated using official statistical data or acknowledged EEIO tables \\nproviding region- or sector-specific average emission factors expressed per economic \\nactivity (e.g., tCO2e/€ of revenue or tCO2e/€ of asset).126\\nData required\\nWithin the due diligence and monitoring of a project finance transaction, the availability and \\nquality of project-specific data is generally good.

For example, in the case of a \\ngas-fired power plant, construction emissions would be accounted during the construction phase \\nand operational emissions during the operational phase. However, if the loan is repaid shortly \\nafter operation starts, the portfolio emissions for that investment would only reflect a small \\nportion of the total emissions impact created during the lifetime of that gas-fired power plant. \\nAs the power plant is often constructed by a third party (i.e., a construction company) contracted \\nby the project developer, the emissions of the construction and purchased goods and services are \\nnormally reported under scope 3 of the project developer. These scope 3 emissions are usually \\nnot significant enough to report or they might be unavailable, in which case no emissions will be \\nreported. When these scope 3 emissions are relevant, they should be reported. \\nTo address the above, a financial institution should, if they are an initial sponsor or lender, assess \\nthe total projected lifetime scope 1 and 2 emissions for projects that were financed during the \\nreporting year. Those emissions should be reported separately in the year of contracting. If a \\nfinancial institution would be an initial lender for the above example of a gas-fired power plant, it \\nshould report in the year of contracting the total projected lifetime scope 1 and 2 emissions based \\non the installed capacity of the plant, the expected load factor of the plant, the expected lifetime \\nof the plant, and the expected carbon content of the gas used.  \\nPortfolio vs. (annualized) lifetime emissions\\nVarious (multilateral) development banks have been working on harmonizing GHG accounting \\nof new projects under the IFI Framework for a Harmonized Approach to Greenhouse Gas \\nAccounting.136 These financial institutions developed a methodology to calculate the expected \\nemissions of newly signed contracts for specific projects in the reporting year.137 In the IFI \\nmethodology, avoided emissions are assessed using emission factors (called combined margin) \\nthat incorporate future greening of the electricity grid. These avoided emissions are annualized \\nand reported in the year of loan/equity origination. \\nUnlike the IFI methodology, PCAF’s portfolio GHG accounting involves calculating the annual \\nemissions linked to the financial institution’s balance sheet and using emission factors (operating \\nmargin) that are based on the existing fossil fuel power plants in a country or region whose \\noperation will be most affected (reduced) by the project. \\nPCAF considers portfolio and (annualized) lifetime GHG accounting to be complementary. \\nPortfolio GHG accounting better lends itself to target setting compared to a global carbon \\nbudget, whereas (annualized) lifetime GHG accounting can be used to reflect the generated \\nemissions or avoided emissions over the operational lifetime.

When a CRE loan is modified (e.g., loan amount is increased, renewed, refinanced, \\nor extended) and a new property value is obtained as part of the transaction, the property value \\nat origination shall be updated to the property value at the time of the modification.\\nWhen asset owners invest in CRE, they either fully finance the property or partially finance it \\nthrough joint ventures, joint operation, or in joint ownership with other asset owners. When CRE \\nis fully financed by an asset owner and the asset owner doesn’t have operational control over the \\nbuilding, 100% of the building’s emissions are attributed to the asset owner’s financed emissions. \\nWhen CRE is jointly financed by a group of asset owners, the attribution is based on the share \\ninvested by each asset owner.\\n139 For example, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is working on creating an approach for the \\nembedded carbon of constructions. At this point, they are defining a theoretical approach with a working group consisting of real \\nestate developers, building material producers, construction companies, and technical consultants. The key in this approach is \\nto use a life cycle assessment to obtain average values of embedded carbon per square meter of building, which will differ per \\nclimate zone and building typology.\\n140 For loan providers, the outstanding amount in the numerator is defined as the value of the debt that the borrower owes to the \\nlender (i.e., disbursed debt minus any repayments). It will be adjusted annually to reflect the correct exposure, resulting in the \\nattribution to decline to 0 at the end of the lifetime of the loan (i.e., when it is fully repaid).\\n141 Availability of property value at origination varies by country.

Some municipal governments are collecting building energy data, and this could \\nprove useful for some financial institutions.\\nSome country-specific adjustments will need to be made to make the calculation applicable \\ndepending on the data availability and standards in each country. The variations across countries \\nin their systems of categorizing the energy efficiency of buildings require a tailored approach for \\noptimal accuracy in calculations. \\nProperty value\\nThis Financed Emissions Standard requires financial institutions to use the property values \\ndetermined at loan or equity origination in relation to the original value of the property. Thus, \\nusing the outstanding amount to the original value provides a consistent estimate of the \\nproportion of the project attributable to the loan and investment. Nevertheless, PCAF recognizes \\nthat the availability of property value at loan or equity origination varies globally. In some \\ncountries, financial institutions can easily retrieve the property value at origination from their \\nbooks and do not typically update it on an annual basis. In other countries, regulators require \\nfinancial institutions to update property values annually.\\nConsidering these differences, and to ensure as much consistency as possible in the calculations, \\nwhen financial institutions do not have the property value at origination, they shall use the \\nlatest property value available. In addition, they shall fix this value for the following years of GHG \\naccounting, i.e., the denominator remains constant from the first year of GHG accounting onward.\\nThe property value includes the value of the land, the building, and any building improvements.\\n145 When selecting an emission factor based on floor space, financial institutions should make sure that the unit of the emission \\nfactor matches the type of floor area, e.g., net floor area, usable floor, etc.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Because these tests are used to verify that cars sold in the US meet EPA regulatory standards, their results reflect \\nthe road performance of passenger cars in the US. The results for more than 4,000 makes and models are publicly available on \\nfueleconomy.gov, downloadable in .csv format.\\n172 The WLTP is a global, harmonized standard of drive cycle tests to determine the tailpipe emissions and fuel efficiency of \\npassenger cars. It was developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to replace the old New European \\nDriving Cycle (NEDC) as the European vehicle homologation procedure. The NEDC was shown to be flawed, enabling \\nmanufacturers to meet EU environmental standards during lab tests but not on the road (Dieselgate). The WLTP was conceived \\nto rectify this. The WLTP final version was published in 2015. Hence, even though it will become a truly international standard \\nin time, it is only used in the EU for now, and its results only reflect the performance of cars sold within the EU. These results \\nare published by the EEA in .csv format and can be downloaded at https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/co2-cars-\\nemission-16.\\n173 The ICCT’s Transportation Roadmap has been a global reference for environmental performance data on all major transportation \\nmodes, fuel types, and vehicle technologies since 2012.

Both sovereign loans and bonds lead to the transfer of funds to the country, \\nwhich in turn creates a debt obligation to be repaid by the borrowing country.\\nSovereign debt is typically issued by the central government or treasury. Financial institutions’ \\nexposure to central banks typically consists of cash, foreign exchange, and derivative (repo) \\ntransactions. This central bank exposure is not within scope of this accounting standard. \\nHowever, in some countries, central banks also issue debt on behalf of the sovereign. In those \\ncases, central banks should be assigned the emissions of the respective sovereign.\\nIt is challenging to extend this methodology to sub-sovereign and municipal counterparties \\ndue to very limited data availability and because these counterparties are not directly subject \\nto international GHG emissions inventory standards (e.g., by the United Nations Framework \\nConvention on Climate Change [UNFCCC]). Therefore, these counterparties are not explicitly part \\nof this asset class. \\nIn terms of covering supranationals – these supranationals are political unions first, and their \\nbalance sheets represent the aggregated balance sheets of their members. Technically, it is \\npossible to aggregate the GHG emissions of supranationals as a sum of the emissions of its \\nmembers. Practically, this would lead to double counting. However, the aggregated view can be \\nuseful for engagement with respective bodies.\\nEmissions covered\\nFinancial institutions shall report sovereign borrowers’ absolute scope 1 and should report scope \\n2 and 3 in line with the proposed scope definitions below.\\nScope definition:\\nThe GHG Protocol’s definition of scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions was initially developed for \\nclassification of corporate emissions.

Absolute financed emissions at a portfolio level are \\nnot a good metric to compare or benchmark financial institutions on their performance due \\nthe potential differences between financial institutions in terms of size, product portfolio, \\nexposure to sectors and regions, etc. For comparability and benchmarking, the absolute \\nfinanced emissions need to be translated into an emission intensity metric (emissions per a \\nspecific unit). 192\\nA wide array of intensity metrics is applied in the market and each has its own merits.

GHG accounting refers to the processes required to consistently measure and report the amount of GHGs generated, avoided, or removed by an entity, allowing it to track and report these emissions over time. It enables financial institutions to disclose these emissions at a fixed point in time and in line with financial accounting periods.  Until now, there has not been a globally accepted standard for measuring and reporting emissions associated with capital market activities. This new Standard constitutes PCAF (2023) The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard Part B: Facilitated Emissions for the Financial Industry. As such, these Standards supplement the requirements of the GHG Protocol 'Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard'.  This document is the first version of the Facilitated Emissions Standard. It provides detailed methodological guidance for the measurement and disclosure of GHG emissions associated with capital market transactions. It is anticipated that the Facilitated Emissions Standard will be reviewed again once the revised GHG Protocol Corporate Standards have been published. This will allow experiences of implementing the Standard and expected updates to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards to be incorporated.  The Facilitated Emissions Standard provides detailed guidance to calculate the facilitated emissions resulting from capital market activities. By following the methodologies, financial institutions can measure GHG emissions for each segment and produce disclosures that are consistent, comparable, reliable, and clear.  Limited data is often the main challenge in calculating facilitated emissions; however, data limitations should not deter financial institutions from starting their GHG accounting journeys. The Facilitated Emissions Standard provides guidance on data quality scoring per segment, facilitating data transparency and encouraging improvements to data quality in the medium and long term.  This Facilitated Emissions Standard also provides recommendations and requirements for reporting. Any requirements not fulfilled must be accompanied by an explanation.  This Facilitated Emissions Standard equips the financial industry with standardized, robust methods to measure and disclose facilitated emissions.   \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

GHG accounting provides the starting point to assess and disclose climate-related risks, set science-based targets, and inform climate strategies and actions that direct capital in support of the alignment of financial flows with the Paris Agreement’s goals. Although PCAF’s Standard for Financed Emissions accounting (Part A) continues to grow to cover additional asset classes and the Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard (Part C) continues to be used more frequently, there has been increasing global interest for additional GHG accounting guidance. More precisely, a specific interest to cover those activities that may be classified as facilitated emissions, such as capital market activities.  Within the financial sector, Capital Markets (where companies and governments raise debt and equity) play a crucial role in fueling economic activity and providing needed funding. In 2022 alone, global long-term bond issuance was $22.5 trillion and global equity issuance was $0.4 trillion, meaning that total capital market issuance was $22.9 trillion.2 This first version of the Facilitated Emissions Standard (Part B) now covers the emissions associated with primary capital market issuance activities (see chapter 5). It is expected that this Facilitated Emissions Standard will be expanded with additional financial sector activities and products that are associated with facilitating emissions in the coming years.  THE IMPORTANCE OF CAPITAL MARKETS Capital Markets sit at the nexus of financial flows that must increasingly be directed towards more sustainable practices if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Furthermore, a capital market issuances that occurs in a particular year will impact the climate for many subsequent years. Actors within these markets have an opportunity to help those financial flows move into activities that minimize climate impact. These actors include the following: • Those who raise funding in Capital Markets (the issuers), such as governments and private sector companies. • The investors in Capital Market instruments who are the providers of this funding. • Those who facilitate and enable these complex multi-party transactions, i.e., facilitators.  For two of these three actors, there are already GHG accounting methodologies in place. For issuers, the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard can be applied (also applicable for non-corporate organizations). For investors, Part A of the PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry3 has been available since November 2020. However, no harmonized accounting standard is yet in place for actors facilitating capital market transactions.  WHO ARE FACILITATORS AND WHAT IS THEIR ROLE Facilitators are mostly large international banks that conduct substantial capital market facilitation activities including advising issuers on structure, pricing, and process; preparing materials for, and engaging with, investors; and arranging and guiding clients on roadshows. These facilitation services are critical to the functioning of Capital Markets. Through this facilitation role, banks are in a unique position to help their clients meet the growing sustainability demands and climate considerations of investors. To help limit climate change and achieve net-zero emission targets by 2050, Capital Markets need to redistribute a large amount of capital to green and sustainable companies that follow GHG emissions protocols with net-zero targets with projects, products, and services to support ______ 2  Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Capital Markets Fact Book, 2023 3  PCAF (2022).

Financial institutions can take up several roles as facilitators. These roles vary by product and market, and are summarized as follows:4 • Lead Bookrunner: This includes both active and passive bookrunners. Lead bookrunners typically lead on the largest percentage of a deal’s economics. Active bookrunners are responsible for most deal support (i.e., investor book, allocations, roadshow) and they are compensated with the highest fees. Passive bookrunners do not have access to the investor order book. • Co-Manager/Lead Manager: These institutions are invited into a deal by the active bookrunners but the activities they undertake are less significant. Economics for lead/co-managers are typically smaller in relationship to the bookrunners. Given their passive role, co-managers are not captured in the Standard.   WHICH FACILITATING ACTIVITIES ARE COVERED This Facilitated Emissions Standard is based on the facilitation activity of the bookrunners and managers in a capital market issuance. Although these financial institutions do not provide the capital directly, they play a key role in an issuer’s capacity to expand or transition. Crucially, this activity can include a material part of business activities. Therefore, the influence of financial institutions on Capital Markets and the associated financial flows can be substantial. If Capital Markets are to channel more financing into climate-friendly projects and businesses, all actors in these markets need to be as transparent as possible to the market and wider stakeholders about their role and the impact of these activities on climate change.  This Facilitated Emissions Standard includes the primary issuance of capital market instruments and loan syndication. Loan syndication involves a group of lenders that fund portions of a loan for a single borrower. A primary issuance includes new securities to provide debt-based or equity-based financing. For the purposes of this Facilitated Emissions Standard, primary issuances are those issuances where a financial institution may propose a beginning price range for a given security and oversee its sale to investors on a best-efforts basis. This Facilitated Emissions Standard only covers the portion of primary issuances that are sold to investors. In the case of an under-subscribed issuance, any unsold securities are not accounted for within the scope of this Facilitated Emissions Standard. The scope of this Facilitated Emissions Standard includes: \\n Sovereign bonds,7 securitized products (including asset-backed securities), covered bonds, derivative financial products (e.g., futures, options, swaps) and advisory services such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are not covered by the scope of this Facilitated Emissions Standard.  ______ 4   Capital Market Instruments Proposed Methodology for Facilitated Emissions 2022 5    Medium-term notes are excluded when issued by government agencies. 6     A syndicated loan transaction is defined as a loan made available by two or more providers under a common loan agreement        and ranking credit is assigned upon signature of the loan documentation. If these fundamental tests cannot be applied, it will        not be considered for inclusion. 7    US agency, non-US agency, supranational and subnational bonds are excluded as well.  • Facilitated issuance of new: - Public debt: all types of bonds issued for general purposes (including sustainability-linked bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate medium-term notes5) - Public equity: common stock (IPOs and follow-on issuances) and preferred shares • Facilitated equity investments in private companies (including private placements) • Facilitated debt investments in private companies (including private credit) • Syndicated loans6 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

PCAF has prioritized the development of a method covering green bonds moving forward.  THE PURPOSE OF REPORTING FACILITATED EMISSIONS OF PRIMARY CAPITAL MARKET ISSUANCE As the intermediary between organizations seeking debt or equity capital and investors looking for more investment opportunities, financial institutions need to develop a mechanism to provide transparency about the GHG emissions associated with capital distributed via capital market activities. Several key stakeholders including the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the UN-convened Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) have asked for more transparency around capital market activities.  This proposed methodology provides a GHG accounting methodology for the facilitation of capital market activities. This method creates a mechanism that helps provide transparency and accountability and will enable the following: \\n Box 1-1. Sustainable finance reporting and PCAF Many financial institutions have commitments to raise financing for sustainable and climate-related activities. These commitments have been made to demonstrate the role financial institutions can play in scaling climate solutions. Sustainable finance reporting is a separate and distinct concept where financial institutions are simply reporting the actual amount of financing that is either directly lent to, invested in, or arranged for the purpose of sustainable activity – it does not involve the attribution of emissions or avoided emissions to that financing as would be the case for calculating financed and facilitated emissions.   PCAF does not offer guidance on reporting requirements for sustainable or any type of financing where there is no attribution of emissions involved. However, financial institutions may consider, as appropriate, how to best align the methodologies for how they account for these activities relative to facilitated and financed emissions so that they can communicate in a consistent manner what their contribution is to any loan or transaction.  HOW FACILITATED EMISSIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM FINANCED EMISSIONS Facilitated emissions differ from financed emissions in two respects: they are rarely held on a financial institution’s balance sheet (representing services rather than financing); and a financial institution’s association with the transaction is temporary. PCAF views facilitation as a separate but important metric, which exerts a material impact on the direction of capital towards economic activities that will enable the transition to net-zero by 2050. • The ability to consistently define the quantity of GHG emissions associated with financial institutions’ facilitation of capital market activities. • The incentive for FIs engaged in facilitation to assess/compare the GHG emissions profile of (potential) issuers, allowing for more informed decisions.  • More informed analysis and comparison of the financial institutions engaged in facilitation activity by their investors and other stakeholders.

On-balance sheet exposure (e.g., loans and investments) are usually held for relatively long time periods (typically years) on a financial institution’s balance sheet and exposes the financial institutions to credit risk. By contrast, capital market transactions are rarely held on a financial institution’s balance sheet. They are facilitated, using various services the facilitating institution provides, rather than financed, because the institution is not providing financing directly to the issuer. This leads to a temporary association with transactions (usually days or weeks) and where usually no financial (credit) risk taken by the financial institution. As a result, there is a distinction in the concept of emissions ownership.  Although facilitation and lending/investing are commercial activities, which will earn revenue, they are fundamentally different in nature and the financial institution’s role differs in these activities.  This proposed methodology does not cover how targets should be set for facilitated emissions. We expect this work to be covered by other bodies concerned with target setting – PCAF is focused exclusively on GHG accounting and disclosure.  STANDARDIZING GHG ACCOUNTING IN CAPITAL MARKETS This document is the first version of the ‘Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for Facilitated Emissions’. Throughout this document, it will be referred to as the Facilitated Emissions Standard. This Facilitated Emissions Standard constitutes Part B of the ‘Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry’. The purpose of this Facilitated Emissions Standard is to provide financial institutions with transparent, standardized, and robust methodologies to measure and report facilitated emissions, as a supplement to the requirements of the GHG Protocol \"Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\".   PCAF first published a discussion paper in November 2021, which looked at key design choices in developing a methodology for the accounting of facilitated emissions associated with the arranging of capital market issuances (when the facilitation activity should be captured; how the responsibility should be split between the facilitators; and allocating emissions), as well as proposed options. Then, in October 2022, PCAF published a public consultation paper to determine the percentage weighting of GHG emissions to facilitators.

Capital Market activities are part of “Managed Investments and Client Services” as listed in Table 1.1 below. The accounting guidance provided by the GHG Protocol on these types on investments is very limited. The protocol only states that “Companies may account for emissions from managed investments and client services in scope 3 category 15 (investments)”. In absence of additional guidance, PCAF has taken the 5 core principles of the GHG Protocol and the derived PCAF requirements (see chapter 4) as starting point for the developing this Facilitated Emissions Standard (see chapter 4).  \\n Source: (WRI and WBCSD, 2011), adapted by PCAF, 2023  Beyond reporting the scope 3 category 15 emissions covered by this Facilitated Emissions Standard, financial institutions shall also measure and report their scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as any other relevant categories of scope 3 emissions in line with the GHG Protocol’s standards.

In 2018 PCAF expanded into North America and went global in September 2019. PCAF aims to standardize the way financial institutions measure and report financed emissions, insurance-associated emissions, and facilitated emissions. In addition, it aims to increase the number of financial institutions that commit to measuring and disclosing these scope 3 emissions in line with the methods it develops.  In 2020, the first edition of the \"Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry\" covering financed emissions (“Financed Emissions Standard”) was published. Since then, financial institutions have asked to expand the standard with more methods, also covering other activities of the financial industry. From 2021 onwards, PCAF started the work on three parts under the umbrella of the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry: \\n HOW TO READ THIS FACILITATED EMISSIONS STANDARD  This Facilitated Emissions Standard uses the following language to indicate which provisions are requirements, which are recommendations, and which are allowable options that financial institutions may choose to follow. The following terms are used throughout this Facilitated Emissions Standard: \\n \\n  \\n• Part A: update of the first version standard on measuring and reporting financed emissions (\"Financed Emissions Standard - second version\")  • Part B: development of a standard for measuring and reporting the GHG emissions associated to the capital market facilitation activities (\"Facilitated Emissions Standard\")  • Part C: development of a standard for measuring and reporting the GHG emissions associated to re/insurance underwriting portfolios (\"Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard\") • \"Shall\" or \"required\": indicates what is required for a GHG inventory to conform with this Facilitated Emissions Standard. • \"Should\": indicates a recommendation but not a requirement. • \"May\": indicates an allowed option. • \"Needs\", \"can\", and \"cannot\": provide guidance on implementing a requirement or to indicate when an action is or is not possible.

The emissions measured are the seven gases mandated under the Kyoto Protocol and needed to be included in national inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). For ease of accounting, these gases are usually converted to and expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).  GHG accounting is commonly used by governments, corporations, and other entities to measure the direct and indirect emissions that occur throughout their value chains as a result of organizational and business activities. According to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard,11 direct emissions are emissions from sources owned or controlled by the reporting company. Indirect emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the operations of the reporting company, but that occur at sources owned or controlled by another company.  Direct and indirect emissions are further categorized by scope and distinguished according to the source of the emissions and where in an organization’s value chain the emissions occur. The three scopes defined by the GHG Protocol—scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3—are briefly described below and are illustrated in Figure 2-1.  • Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions that occur from sources owned or controlled by the reporting company—i.e., emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc. • Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating, or cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 2 emissions physically occur at the facility where the electricity, steam, heating, or cooling is generated. • Scope 3: All other indirect GHG emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company. Scope 3 can be broken down into upstream emissions that occur in the supply chain (for example, from production or extraction of purchased materials) and downstream emissions that occur as a consequence of using the organization’s products or services.  The GHG Protocol \\'Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\\'12 categorizes scope 3 emissions into 15 categories, as shown in Figure 2-1. According to the GHG Protocol, accounting and reporting on emissions associated with a reporting company’s capital market related activities are optional under scope 3 category 15 (Investments, other investments, or financial services). This Facilitated Emissions Standard now clarifies and requires that capital market facilitated emissions are to be reported as a separate and supplementary accounting note within scope 3 category 15 (Investments).

The total volume of GHG emissions emitted and facilitated by a financial institution is commonly referred to as its generated (absolute) emissions. The core focus of this Facilitated Emissions Standard is the aggregated GHG emissions emitted and facilitated over the reporting year by the financial institution itself or its facilitated parties.   However, not all capital market activities are associated with generated facilitated emissions. Facilitation can also contribute to the deployment of emission removal solutions that absorb CO2e from the atmosphere and store it in durable materials, terrestrial carbon sinks, or in geological reservoirs deep underground. For instance, issuing green bonds for sustainable forestry projects is likely to increase the forest carbon stock through diversification of tree species, more underbrush, and healthier forest soils. Other examples are Direct Air Capture technologies that can capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere and durably store it, for instance into carbonate minerals locked inside concrete blocks. The volume of CO2e absorbed and durably stored is considered an emission removal that can also be quantified and reported.  Carbon removal activities will become important to achieve global net-zero, namely, to neutralize (balance) residual emissions. Currently, though, there are no final international rules for carbon removals accounting. Final guidance by the GHG Protocol on emissions removals is expected to be \\nFigure 2-1.

For the time being, PCAF refers to the forthcoming guidance from the GHG Protocol. Future versions of this Facilitated Emissions Standard may potentially include more specific guidance on emissions removals.  Lastly, emissions accounting in the real economy sometimes compares actual emissions of a zero- or low-emission project (project emissions) to the hypothetical emissions of high-emission alternatives (baseline emissions). The difference between the two is referred to as avoided emissions. This Facilitated Emissions Standard does not cover methods to quantify avoided emissions, in absence of credible and widely accepted standards for corporate and financed emissions.   When a financial institution chooses to report on emission removals or avoided emissions they shall always do so separately from the financial institution’s scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG inventories, shall apply the same accounting principles (including attribution and weighting) as for its generated facilitated emissions, and shall report their methodological formula for calculating these types of emissions (i.e., emission removals and avoided emissions) in accordance with the guidance contained in Chapter 6.    \\n______ 13  The GHG Protocol's 'Land Sector and Removals Guidance' is currently being developed through a multi-stakeholder development process.

GHG accounting of capital market instruments can help financial institutions achieve multiple objectives, such as creating transparency for stakeholders, managing financial risks associated with climate policies and regulations, creating new financial instruments to further the transition to net-zero, and aligning financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement (Figure 3-1). Financial institutions cite these business goals as the key reasons for assessing emissions associated with their financial activities, but this list is by no means exhaustive. This chapter will elaborate on these goals in greater detail.         The level of detail captured in the assessment of facilitated emissions could dictate how well the inventory can meet the business goals of the financial institution. For example, if a financial institution uses the inventory to manage risk, it may consider measuring and recording sector-level emissions to identify emission-intensive industry activities in its portfolios. Other financial institutions may want to structure their inventory in a way that helps them track their facilitated emissions reduction goals year-over-year. In the end, what is captured in the GHG inventory should serve the business goals of the financial institution.  BUSINESS GOAL 1: CREATE TRANSPARENCY FOR STAKEHOLDERS Financial institutions motivated to be more transparent about their climate impact can use GHG accounting to measure and report the facilitated emissions. Transparency, especially around readiness for the low-carbon transition and risk of stranded assets, can help companies and financial institutions identify how capital expenditure may be re-allocated to provide risk-adjusted returns as decarbonization occurs. In response to demand and the consensus that climate change poses a considerable threat to the global economy, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) launched the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2015. The TCFD framework15 has expanded since the first recommendations were launched in 2017 to be the global guidance on how companies should disclose their climate-related risks and opportunities. At the time of the publication of this edition of the Facilitated Emissions Standard, TCFD-recommended disclosures are mostly voluntary.16 However, with strong backing from central banks, the Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and the industry itself, companies will likely face new regulatory requirements in this related to the emissions associated with financial activities in the future.  ______ 15  TCFD, 2017 16  Except in New Zealand, where the government introduced mandatory TCFD disclosures in September 2020: https://bit.ly/2TWUxwm. The UK also hopes to enshrine mandatory climate disclosures in line with TCFD recommendations in a new law which would take effect as soon as April 2022, subject to Parliamentary approval. https://bit.ly/35B0rwF  Figure 3-1.

Assessing facilitated emissions allows the board members and senior management of financial institutions to get a better picture of their organization’s impact on the climate and how to facilitate activities toward the goals of the Paris Agreement. By measuring and disclosing facilitated emissions, and thereby creating opportunities for climate disclosure, financial institutions can internally align on their role, as well as the financial sector’s responsibility, in the transition to a net-zero economy.  BUSINESS GOAL 2: MANAGE CLIMATE-RELATED TRANSITION RISKS Financial institutions are increasingly comprehending the exposure of their activities to risks posed by climate-related policies and regulations. GHG accounting helps these institutions screen and identify areas of their financial activities that fall under emission-intensive assets. Such financial activities could suffer setbacks resulting from the introduction of carbon prices, policies and regulations that are aimed at reducing emissions in carbon-intensive sectors.  In addition, financial institutions that do not disclose their climate-related risks could face reputational risk, especially if peers are increasingly doing so. Measuring and disclosing facilitated emissions according to the Facilitated Emissions Standard is a way for financial institutions to manage their climate-related reputational risk. By applying the GHG accounting methods in this Facilitated Emissions Standard, financial institutions can identify areas of significant exposure to emission-intensive assets across their financial activities and use this information as the basis to assess climate risk scenarios. By disclosing in line with the requirements and recommendations in Chapter 6 of this Facilitated Emissions Standard, financial institutions can show that they are serious about climate action.   BUSINESS GOAL 3: DEVELOP CLIMATE-FRIENDLY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS For financial institutions, significant opportunities exist in the development of financial instruments that aid in achieving their own and their clients’ climate ambitions.   \\n With the transition to a low-carbon economy, financial institutions can develop innovative products and services that enable their clients to decarbonize their business activities. By measuring facilitated emissions, financial institutions can see which sectors and businesses require the most help in their decarbonization efforts, and how best to support them in their transition to a net-zero future.

These institutions use this information as the basis for analyzing decarbonization scenarios and setting emission-based targets at the asset class or sector level. While other climate initiatives focus on scenario analysis and target setting, PCAF has been established to focus solely on the GHG accounting of financial activities. Undertaking GHG accounting equips financial institutions with a metric that can help track absolute emissions year over year and compare it with their facilitated emissions goals.

Disclose and justify any specific exclusions. Recognition Financial institutions shall account for all facilitated emissions from the primary issuance of capital market instruments23 under scope 3 category 15,24, 25 as defined by the GHG Protocol \\'Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\\'. Any limitations or restrictions shall be disclosed. Consistency Use consistent methodologies to allow for meaningful performance tracking of emissions over time. Transparently document any changes to the data, inventory boundary, methods, or any other relevant factors in the time series. Measurement Financial institutions shall measure and report their absolute facilitated emissions from capital market issuance by “following the money” and using the PCAF methodologies and guidance provided in the Facilitated Emissions Standard. If data availability and methodologies allow, avoided, and removed emissions may also be measured and reported. Relevance Ensure the GHG inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the company and serves the decision-making needs of users — both internal and external to the company. An important aspect of relevance is the selection of an appropriate inventory boundary that reflects the substance and economic reality of the company’s business relationships. Attribution The financial institution’s share of facilitated emissions shall be proportional to the share of its exposure to the total value of the issuance, per the methodology outlined in chapter 5.   Accuracy Ensure that the quantification of GHG emissions is systematically neither over nor under actual emissions, as far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Achieve sufficient accuracy to enable users to make decisions with reasonable confidence as to the integrity of the reported information. Data quality Financial institutions shall use the highest data quality available for capital market issuance and the underlying assets/companies and improve the quality of the data over time.   Transparency Address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on a clear audit trail. Disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate references to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used. Disclosure Public disclosure of the results of the PCAF assessment is crucial for external stakeholders, and financial institutions using the methodology, to have a clear, comparable view on how capital market activities of financial institutions contribute to the Paris Agreement\\'s climate goals.    ______ 20  WRI and WBCSD, 2004 21  WRI and WBCSD, 2011 22  https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf, p.7 23  Capital market instruments are financial assets that are sold by companies or governments who seek capital. 24  Category 15 of the \\'Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions\\' does not explicitly refer to capital markets.

This Facilitated Emissions Standard follows these five core principles and provides five additional requirements for the application of these principles that are directly relevant for facilitators wishing to assess their capital market facilitated emissions (Table 4-1).  4.2  Additional requirements for accounting and reporting emissions from capital market activities This section describes the additional requirements for GHG accounting for Capital Markets and its facilitators and how these requirements guide accounting for and reporting of facilitated emissions.   RECOGNITION Financial institutions shall account for all emissions that are associated with capital markets instrument and justify any exclusions. They shall be reported separately under scope 3 Category 15 26,27 as defined by the \\'GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\\'. They shall be measured and reported as a supplementary accounting note and shall not be aggregated with financed emissions. Any limitations or restrictions shall be explained and disclosed.   MEASUREMENT “Follow the money” is a key tenet for GHG accounting, meaning that the money should be followed as far as possible to understand and account for the climate impact in the real economy, i.e., emissions caused by the financial institution’s financial activities.   Financial institutions shall measure and report their facilitated emissions using the methodologies set out in this Facilitated Emissions Standard and covering the seven GHGs required under the Kyoto Protocol. As a minimum, financial institutions shall measure the absolute GHG emissions resulting from facilitating activities (scope 3 category 15 emissions) in the reporting year. When relevant, emission removals should be measured and reported separately. Avoided emissions may also be measured and reported separately. However, in absence of credible accounting guidance, financial Institutions shall disclose the methodology and formulas adopted in calculating such emissions.   As a basis for reporting emissions, financial institutions shall choose a fixed point in time to determine their financial data needed to calculate an attribution factor, such as the last day of its fiscal year (e.g., June 30 or December 31). The GHG accounting period shall align with the financial accounting period.  ATTRIBUTION The financial institution’s share of facilitated emissions shall be proportional to the share of its exposure relative to the total value of the intended borrower or investee. The Standard applies the same attribution principles for all parts. It is crucial for financial institutions to consider equity and debt equally important in calculations and avoid double counting.  ______ 26  Category 15 of the \\'Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions\\' does not explicitly refer to capital markets. It solely focuses on \"investments\" and providing such \"financial services\" and \"client services\". I.e., the reporting of any kind of capital market facilitated emissions is considered to be a voluntary broadening of the interpretation of the Technical Guidance due to the facilitator’s own ambitions and goals. 27  As described, the reported figures in the context of facilitated emissions for capital markets might, however, not be at all comparable with emissions being reported for the facilitator’s own or financed emissions.

Facilitated  emissions and double counting  \\nDouble counting, which occurs when GHG emissions are counted more than once in the \\nfacilitated emissions calculation of one or more institutions , or across different parts of the \\nStandard, should  be minimized as much as possible. This can be done by splitting -out emissions \\nreporting by the different emission scopes and financial activities that inherently have the \\npotential for overlapping emissions. Beyond the double counting of facilitated emissions itself, \\nthere will also be double counting between financed (Part A), facilitated (Part B) and insurance \\nassociated (Part C) emissions. However, given the very different nature of these activi ties and \\ndifferent ways to influence decision making, this is not considered an issue when emissions are \\nclearly reported separately.  \\nEven though double counting is a frequent and inherent aspect of GHG accounting it does not \\nneed to be as seen as problematic, if:  \\n•double counting does not interfere with stated decarbonization goals and ;\\n•methodologies and limitations are stated transparently as part of the disclosure.\\nOne of PCAF’s goals is to develop harmonized and transparent methodologies to measure and \\nreport emissions associated with loans, investments, provision of insurance, and other financial \\nproducts and services.

Financial institutions, in their role as facilitators, play a critical role in the issuance of capital market instruments.  The GHG emissions associated with capital market issuances are known as “facilitated emissions”. This methodology aims to balance the fair attribution of emissions to the facilitator with due consideration given to practical implementation.  This chapter includes guidance on the following elements as a part of the method to measure capital market instruments: • Attribution of emissions • Emission scopes covered • Formulas to calculate facilitated emissions • Data required • Limitations  5.1  Scope of capital market activities and coverage of roles This Facilitated Emissions Standard includes the primary issuance of capital market instruments and loan syndication. Loan syndication involves a group of lenders that fund portions of a loan for a single borrower. A primary issuance includes new securities to provide debt-based or equity-based financing. For the purposes of this Facilitated Emissions Standard, primary issuances are those issuances where a financial institution may propose a beginning price range for a given security and oversee its sale to investors on a best-efforts basis. This Facilitated Emissions Standard only covers the portion of primary issuances that are sold to investors. In the case of an under-subscribed issuance, any unsold securities are not accounted for within the scope of this Facilitated Emissions Standard. The scope of this Facilitated Emissions Standard includes: \\n Sovereign bonds30, securitized products (including asset-backed securities), covered bonds, derivative financial products (e.g., futures, options, swaps) and advisory services such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are not covered by the scope of this Facilitated Emissions Standard. The same holds for green bonds since no PCAF method exists yet to calculate the emissions associated with green bonds and other known use of proceeds bonds. PCAF has prioritized the development of a method covering green bonds moving forward.    ______ 28    Medium-term notes are excluded when issued by government agencies. 29     A syndicated loan transaction is defined as a loan made available by two or more providers under a common loan          agreement and ranking credit is assigned upon signature of the loan documentation. If these fundamental tests cannot be          applied, it will not be considered for inclusion. 30   US agency, non-US agency, supranational and subnational bonds are excluded as well. • Facilitated issuance of new: - Public debt: all types of bonds issued for general purposes (including sustainability-linked bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate medium-term notes28) - Public equity: common stock (IPOs and follow-on issuances) and preferred shares • Facilitated equity investments in private companies (including private placements) • Facilitated debt investments in private companies (including private credit) • Syndicated loans29 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The roles of co-managers/lead managers are less significant, and the economics are typically smaller in relationship to the lead bookrunners. Given their more passive role, co-managers are currently not captured in this Facilitated Emissions Standard. More information on the classification of the different roles can be found in Chapter 1.  5.2        Attribution of emissions To quantify and attribute the facilitated emissions from primary issuance of capital market instruments three key elements need to be considered.        An accounting method should therefore carefully consider and define these three elements. The section below explains how this Facilitated Emissions Standard defines these elements of the methodology.  Formula for calculating facilitated emissions Facilitated emissions from primary issuances of capital market instruments are calculated using the formula below:   !\"#$%$&\"&\\'(\\t\\'*$++$,-+=/!\"#$%$&\"&\\'(\\t\"*,0-&!\\t1,*2\"-3\\t4\"%0\\'\\t×6\\'$7ℎ&$-7\\t9\"#&,:×;--0\"%\\t\\'*$++$,-+!!     1. Facilitated amount:  Defined as the product of the total amount raised and volume attributed to the financial institution (or league table credit, see Box 5.1.). 2. Company value:  For all listed companies this is the company enterprise value including cash (EVIC) of the respective client. Only for private companies EVIC should be replaced by the sum of the total company equity31 and debt32 when no market value for equity is available.33  ______ 31  In cases where the total company equity value according to the client’s balance sheet is negative, the financial institution shall set total equity to 0; this means that all emissions are attributed to debt only, while no emissions are attributed to equity investments. Such cases can happen when the retained earnings are negative while at the same time being higher than the other equity components on the balance sheet of the client—e.g., this often holds for startups that have high negative profits during their first years of operation. By this approach, for those companies that are doing well (i.e., they have high retained earnings), financial institutions attribute more emissions to equity providers; for those companies doing poorly (i.e., they have high retained losses), financial institutions attribute more emissions to debt providers. This is in line with the attribution factor rationale for listed companies, where the equity part of EVIC (i.e., market capitalization) also implicitly reflects retained earnings and losses (e.g., if retained earnings increase, the share price and market capitalization also increase). 32  Total debt includes both current and long-term debt on the balance sheet.  33  If total debt or total equity cannot be obtained from a client’s balance sheet for whatever reason, financial institutions are allowed to fall back to the total balance sheet value (i.e., the sum of total equity and liabilities, which is equal to the client’s total assets) with the intention of improving this data quality in the future. \\nAnnual emissions: What is the time period over which the facilitation activity is captured? \\ni \\nAttribution factor (facilitated amount/company value): How are emissions allocated between the different facilitators of an issuance? \\nii \\nWeighting factor: How is the responsibility of a facilitator for the issuer\\'s emissions valued?  \\niii ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Box 5-1. How EVIC is defined  EVIC is defined as the sum of the market capitalization of ordinary shares at fiscal year-end, the market capitalization of preferred shares at fiscal year-end, and the book values of total debt34 and minorities’ interests. No deductions of cash or cash equivalents are made to avoid the possibility of negative enterprise values35.   PCAF chose to align the definition of EVIC with the common definition provided by both the:  1. EU TEG in its Handbook of Climate Transition Benchmarks, Paris-Aligned Benchmark and Benchmarks’ ESG Disclosure36; and  2. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 of 17 July 2020 Supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards minimum standards for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, which says EVIC should be used to determine the GHG intensities for the benchmarks.   Box 5 in the Financed Emissions Standard further clarifies the rationale for using EVIC in the attribution factor.   ______ 34  In its EVIC definition, the EU TEG refers to “the book values of total debt,” including all debt as listed on the company balance sheet. This is different from some accounting definitions of book value of debt, which exclude some elements like non-interest-bearing debt (also see next footnote on precautionary principle). 35  This is the standard definition of EVIC as provided by the EU TEG. For consistency reasons, PCAF decided to align with this definition to ensure maximum alignment on metrics in the market, which also enables data providers to collect data in a consistent way. Specific elements of EVIC might not be readily available because data providers are still working on aligning their data with this definition. For cases where data is missing, the EU TEG (pg. 16 in its handbook of climate-related benchmarks) recommends conducting corporate GHG data estimations based on the UN’s (1992) Precautionary principle: “If in doubt, err on the side of the planet not the side of the company.” Following this precautionary approach for EVIC calculations, financial institutions can decide to exclude elements of the EVIC (e.g., minority interests or certain elements of the book value of debt) as this would lead to a slightly lower EVIC and higher attribution of financed emissions to their own outstanding amount. These slight deviations from the standard EVIC definition are allowed as long as: (1) they are in line with this precautionary principle, and (2) the basis of the EVIC definition still includes the market value of equity (market capitalization) plus the total book value of debt of any given company. 36  EU Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, 2019 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Context Unlike the role financial institutions undertake with lending and investing activities, capital market facilitation involves arranging transactions and does not usually involve capital exposure for the financial institution. This arranging activity leads to what is classified as facilitated emissions.  Lending, investing, and financed emissions: Where a financial institution lends funds, it puts at risk its own capital and this exposure remains on its balance sheet for the life of the loan, leading to financed emissions over that period.  Capital market activities and facilitated emissions: Where a financial institution facilitates a capital market issuance, the financial institution generally does not put any of its own capital at risk and so there is no transaction recorded on the financial institutions’ balance sheet. The exception is if the facilitator of a capital market instrument has underwritten any part of the issuance – where a financial institution provides an underwriting facility that puts the institution’s capital at risk, this should be treated separately from the role they provide in arranging and facilitating an issuance. Underwriting facilities are not covered by the scope of this Facilitated Emissions Standard. Note: these underwriting activities are not the same as the underwriting by the re/insurance sector. For more details on these activities, we refer to the PCAF Standard Part C: Insurance-Associated Emissions.37  Methodology As facilitators of capital market instruments, financial institutions are only involved when the transaction is being arranged and launched, they will take no (or limited) capital risk. Given the temporary association with transactions, capital market facilitations are treated differently than lending and investing.  Using this approach, the association with the capital market transaction shall be accounted for in the year the facilitation occurs, using the reported or estimated annual emissions of the issuer in that year. All the transactions during the year are then aggregated over that one year to calculate the total facilitated emissions. This annual period is selected to be in line with other parts of the PCAF Standard. PCAF acknowledges that there may be a time lag in data availability given that emissions data will typically be available 12-15 months after the calendar year-end. Please see the limitations section of this chapter.  The assumption is that — in line with Part A of the PCAF Standard — buyers of the facilitated instruments (both equity and debt) will report their financed emissions separately and for each year that they are invested in the instrument (i.e., assuming there will always be an investor or lender reporting the emissions associated with the issuance until its maturity). In contrast, the facilitator will only report its association with the instrument in the year that the instrument is issued, and the facilitation takes place.   When reporting facilitated emissions next to financed emissions, facilitators shall use the same reporting period. In practice, this means that the facilitator reports the attributed share of the annual emissions of all companies it facilitated for in the same reporting year up until prior to the same fixed point in time chosen to disclose financed emissions. ______ 37  See also PCAF Standard Part C: Insurance-Associated Emissions https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/downloads/pcaf-standard-part-c-insurance-associated-emissions-nov-2022.pdf \\ni ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Context Given that there is typically more than one facilitator in a transaction, it is important to split the responsibilities between the facilitators (e.g., lead/active/passive bookrunners and lead/co-managers), in a consistent manner.  Methodology The facilitators’ responsibility shall be split based on the proportion of the issuance that is allotted to each facilitator for each transaction. As a first preference and if the data is readily available, the specific volume facilitated by the individual financial institution shall be used to determine what proportion of the ‘facilitated’ part of the transaction each facilitator takes responsibility for. If this data is not readily available, league table credit shall be used.   League tables rank financial institutions based on their total capital market activities, by summing up the credit allotted to each facilitator based on their role in an individual transaction. The facilitated amount can be calculated by multiplying the proportion of the issuance assigned to the facilitator by the amount of debt or equity raised. League tables used to track the issuance of capital market issuances generally fall in to one of two categories – league tables based on fees or league tables based on the value of the volume. This Facilitated Emissions Standard allows the use of either league tables based on fees or the value of the volume, but financial institutions shall be transparent about which method they are using in their public reports. As mentioned, economics for co-managers are typically smaller in relationship to the bookrunners, and co-managers are also not accounted for consistently in all league tables – co-managers will therefore currently not be captured in this Facilitated Emissions Standard. Data can be obtained from third-party providers, such as Bloomberg or Dealogic, and financial institutions shall disclose the data source used. Please see an example of applying the league table credit in box 5-2.    Box 5-2. Recommended approach for calculating facilitated emissions when using league table credit  Three facilitators – two lead bookrunners and one co-manager – support a listed Company X with raising capital in the debt market in August 2022. In total, $200 million was raised. Company X reported emissions of 1,000 kt CO2e over the past year. The Enterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC) of Company X on 31st December 2022 is reported as $2 billion.

Context A financial institution’s role in arranging capital market activities is distinct from its role as a  provider of capital to a company.  Although it is important to capture the emissions associated with capital market activities, adjustments should be made to help communicate to stakeholders the different roles in lending or investing versus facilitation. As described in Chapter 1, the role that a facilitator plays in helping a company to issue capital market instruments to investors (i.e., facilitated transactions) is not directly equivalent with the provision of capital by a financial institution when it uses its balance sheet to extend loans and equity (i.e., financed emissions). Using the “follow the money” principle upon which prior PCAF methodologies are built, facilitated emissions are therefore clearly distinct from financed emissions.  Because of the distinct role facilitators play, PCAF includes a “weighting” factor to the facilitated emissions calculation to help distinguish between the two types of emissions – facilitated emissions and financed emissions – acknowledging that a unit of facilitated emissions is not equal to a unit of financed emissions (or insurance-associated emissions) given that no direct funding is provided by the financial institution to the company producing emissions in the real economy; combined with the very short-term role facilitators have in their roles as arrangers.   Several dynamics were considered when determining the appropriate weighting to be used. One such consideration was the fact that the portion of financing that comes from lending versus the portion of financing that comes from capital market activities varies widely across jurisdictions – capital market issuance can represent anywhere between 20% to 80% of total financing (loans and capital markets).   \\niii \\ni \\nii \\niii \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is true when looking across markets.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Basel Framework from 2021 includes a description of the Committee’s indicator-based measurement approach for assessing the systemic importance of global systemically important banks (G-SIB).39 In this approach, the Committee has assigned percentage weightings for the relative importance of certain key activities that banks undertake. These activities include underwritten transactions in debt and equity markets (which includes arranging debt and equity capital market instruments) and total exposures (which includes loans). The relative weighting of these two activities implies the Basel approach weights balance sheet exposures as six times more consequential than underwriting activity – put another other way underwriting (leading to facilitated emissions) is only ~17% as impactful as balance sheet exposures (leading to financed emissions). However, this methodology has been developed to establish which banks are of consequence to global systemic risk and does not consider the broader roles that banks may play in the issuance of a capital market instrument – including acting as a broker between the user and the investors, which is a challenging role to replicate and quantify. Further, these percentage weightings assigned by the Basel Committee are subject to regular review and change. Earlier in 2018, the Basel approach weighted balance sheet exposures as only three times more consequential than underwriting, specifically ~33% as impactful as balance sheet exposures.  Methodology To ensure consistency in facilitated emissions reporting and reflect the fact that a financial institution’s role in facilitating capital market activities is different from its role as a lender, PCAF decided a 33% weighting for all capital market issuances in scope for this Facilitated Emissions Standard to appropriately distinguish between the relative importance of a financing activity versus a facilitation activity. It is also a conservative option as it equals the highest weighted relative importance of underwriting activities versus balance sheet exposure according to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Basel Framework in the 11 years since the G-SIB assessment reports began in 2012.40 This weighting also considers all factors and viewpoints explained in Capital Market Instruments Proposed Methodology for Facilitated Emissions 2022. 41 Therefore, financial institutions shall report their facilitated emissions using a 33% weighting factor and disclose the ______ 38  Source: OECD, Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan, National Bureau of Statistics of China, SIFMA estimates 39  Basel Framework SCO40: https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/SCO/40.htm 40  The past annual G-SIB assessment reports archive: https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/reporting_instructions.htm 41  https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/downloads/pcaf-capital-market-instruments-proposed-methodology-2022.pdf Figure 5-1.

PCAF acknowledges that, to date, the comparability, coverage, transparency, and reliability of scope 3 data still varies greatly per sector and data source. By requiring scope 3 reporting for selected sectors over time, PCAF seeks to make scope 3 emissions reporting more common by improving data availability and quality over time.   Financial institutions shall explain if they are not able to report the required scope 3 emissions because of data availability or uncertainty. For all sectors where PCAF does not yet require scope 3 emissions reporting, financial institutions should follow the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard and only account for scope 3 emissions where relevant.   PCAF provides a sector list detailing where scope 3 emissions of issuers are required to be reported (see Table 5-1). The sector list of PCAF aligns with the scope 3 phase-in approach as defined by the EU TEG, which was included in Article 5 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 of 17 July 2020, Supplements the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards minimum standards for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks.

Score 3 2b Facilitated amount and EVIC or total equity plus debt are known. Reported company emissions are not known. Emissions are calculated using primary physical activity data of the company’s production and emission factors specific to that primary data.  Score 4 Option 3: economic activity-based emissions 3a Facilitated amount, EVIC or total equity plus debt, and the company’s revenue46 are known. Emission factors for the sector per unit of revenue are known (e.g., tCO2e per euro or dollar of revenue earned in a sector). Score 5 3b Facilitated amount is known. Emission factors for the sector per unit of asset (e.g., tCO2e per euro or dollar of asset in a sector) are known. 3c Facilitated amount is known. Emission factors for the sector per unit of revenue (e.g., tCO2e per euro or dollar of revenue earned in a sector) and asset turnover ratios for the sector are known.  A detailed summary of the data quality score table, including data needs and equations to calculate facilitated emissions, is provided in Chapter 10 (Annex). Data for all three options in Table 5-2 can be derived from different data sources.  Data providers (Option 1)  For Option 1 (reported emissions), PCAF recommends either collecting emissions from the issuer company directly (e.g., company sustainability report) or third-party data providers, such as CDP, Bloomberg, MSCI, Sustainalytics, S&P/Trucost, and ISS ESG.  ______ 44  The quality scoring for the Option 2a is only possible for/applicable to scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as scope 3 emissions cannot be estimated by this option. Other options can be used to estimate the scope 3 emissions, however. 45  Supplier-specific emission factors (e.g., from electricity provider) for the respective primary activity data are always preferred over non-supplier-specific emission factors. 46  If revenue is not deemed a suitable financial indicator for estimating the emissions of a company in a certain sector, one can apply other suitable financial indicators as a proxy. If an alternative indicator is used, the reasoning for the selection of this alternative indicator should be made transparent. The data quality score will not be affected. Table 5-2.

PCAF encourages using the most recent available data and to mention the data source, reporting period, or date of publication. Data providers collect emissions data as reported by the companies themselves, either through a standardized framework such as CDP or through a company’s own disclosures in official filings and environmental reports. They often have their own methodologies to estimate calculate companies’ emissions, especially if emissions are not reported. In this case, the calculation would be in line with Options 2 or 3, assuming the methodology used is in line with the GHG Protocol. Data providers should transparently disclose the calculation method they use conform the GHG Protocol and financial institutions should ask their data providers to provide this. This will enable financial institutions to apply the proper score to the data. PCAF also encourages data providers to apply the PCAF scoring method to their own data, which would allow them to share the data quality scores directly with their clients.   PCAF does not recommend a preferred data vendor. PCAF recommends using data providers that use the standardized CDP framework and suggests data providers disclose the data quality score according to the scoring hierarchy in Table 5-2. 47 When using data providers, PCAF recommends using the same provider due to variability of scope 1 and 2 emissions observed between providers.   Estimation models (Option 2 and 3)  Not all companies disclose their emissions data in official filings or through data providers. Reporting in emerging markets often lags that of developed markets. To maximize the coverage of emissions data, the remaining gaps are often filled with estimates.   For Option 2 (physical activity-based emissions), PCAF recommends using actual energy consumption (e.g., megawatt-hours of natural gas consumed) or production (e.g., tons of steel produced) data reported by companies, given the data fully covers the company’s emissions generating activities. The emission factors expressed per physical activity used should be based on appropriate and verified calculation methodologies or tools issued or approved by a credible independent institution. Example data sources for retrieving emission factors are ecoinvent48, Defra49, IPCC50, GEMIS51, and FAO52. The most recent available data should be used, including a mention of the data source, reporting period, or publication date.  For Option 3 (economic activity-based emissions), PCAF recommends using official statistical data or acknowledged EEIO tables providing region- or sector-specific average emission factors expressed per economic activity (e.g., tCO2e/€ or $ of revenue or tCO2e/€ or $ of sectoral assets). Financial institutions should use emission factors that are as consistent as possible with the primary business activity facilitated. For example, for a business loan to a paddy rice farmer, the financial institution should seek to find and use a sector-specific average emission factor for the paddy rice sector and not an emission factor for the agricultural sector in general. Example EEIO databases that can be used to obtain such emission factors are EXIOBASE53, GTAP54, and WIOD55.  ______ 47  More information about CDP can be found at: https://www.cdp.net/en 48  More information can be found at: https://www.ecoinvent.org/ 49  More information can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversionfactors-2021 50  More information can be found at: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/find_ef.php 51  More information can be found at: http://iinas.org/gemis-download.html 52  More information can be found at: http://www.fao.org/partnerships/leap/database/ghg-crops/en 53    More information can be found at: https://www.exiobase.eu 54   More information can be found at: https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu 55   More information can be found at: http://www.wiod.org ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The database, which is only available to PCAF signatories, can help financial institutions get started with estimating the facilitated emissions of their loans and/or investments.   PCAF expects that the facilitated emissions for most capital market transactions can be derived through either reported emissions (Option 1), physical activity data (Option 2), or economic activity data (Option 3). However, PCAF allows the use of alternative options to calculate emissions if none of the specified options can be used or in the case that new options are developed. The reporting financial institution shall always explain the reasons for using an alternative option if it deviates from the three options defined above.  LIMITATIONS Generalized nature of Option 3   One limitation of Option 3, economic activity data, is the generalized nature and necessary assumptions made in applying region- or sector-specific average values (both for emissions and financial data). This makes calculations less robust and more uncertain than those based on data specific to the issuer, as the data for this option largely depends on assumptions and approximations derived from region and sector averages. In addition, statistical data or acknowledged EEIO tables for a given region need to be critically mapped to the sector classification used by the reporting financial institution. As the sectors may not map one-to-one, this may cause facilitated emissions to be over- or understated.  Market value fluctuations When using EVIC as the denominator, calculated facilitated emissions may change as a result of fluctuating market prices throughout the reporting year. Given that EVIC will be reported as of year-end, there may be changes in the EVIC of a company from the date of transaction close to the reporting year-end date. Market price fluctuations may cause discrepancies in the annual facilitated emissions figures, however using fiscal year-end EVIC is the most consistent approach as it aligns with the year-end reporting for financed emissions.  Time lag in data availability  Another limitation of the described options stems from the fact that emissions data is typically available months after the calendar year-end. Given that the issuance is reported in the calendar year of occurrence, the facilitator could have to revert to emissions data from previous years in order to perform the GHG accounting calculations.

PCAF has developed these reporting requirements and recommendations to complement existing frameworks such as \\'GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard’, the \\'Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\\', and the supplemental \\'Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions\\' as indicated in Chapter 1.  Reporting facilitated emissions associated with Capital Market Instruments is “optional” according to the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard at the time of the release of this first version of the Facilitated Emissions Standard, hence all financial institutions that decide to adopt and use the Facilitated Emissions Standard shall follow the requirements therein when publicly disclosing their facilitated emissions.  The requirements for disclosure of facilitated emissions describe a minimum disclosure level with room for financial institutions to report beyond this level. Any requirements not fulfilled must be accompanied by an explanation. Minimum reporting requirements are described in this chapter using the word \"shall\". Where certain aspects of reporting are not required but encouraged as best practice, the word \"should\" is used. An allowed optional recommendation is indicated using the word \"may\".  REPORTING FACILITATED EMISSIONS VS FINANCED EMISSIONS Facilitated emissions shall be reported separately from financed emissions reporting.56 PCAF explains the differences and similarities between financed emissions and facilitated emissions in Chapter 1. For the avoidance of doubt, facilitated emissions and financed emissions are not, and are not intended to be, directly comparable. Thus, facilitated emissions and financed emissions shall not be aggregated, but must be reported separately under the GHG Protocol scope 3 category 15 (Investments).   OVERALL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS • Principles: GHG accounting and reporting from financial institutions shall be based on the following principles: relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency, and accuracy. • Purpose: A financial institution’s reporting should align with its specific business goals; for instance, for identifying and assessing climate-related transition risks and opportunities. • Frequency: Financial institutions shall disclose at least annually and at a fixed point in time in line with the financial accounting cycle. Financial institutions shall ensure that the chosen point in time provides a representative view on the emissions for that reporting year and shall transparently disclose if results are affected by a significant threshold57 close to (before/after) the reporting date. • Recalculation and significance threshold: Financial institutions shall, in line with the \\'GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\\' requirement (page 10458), establish a baseline recalculation policy. This is to define under which circumstances recalculating (base year) facilitated emissions is necessary to ensure the consistency, comparability, and relevance of the reported GHG emissions data over time.

Table 10.2 (in Annex) provides an example template for how financial institutions can disclose their facilitated emissions. • Past performance: Where appropriate and relevant for their business goals, financial institutions should disclose their facilitated emissions for multiple comparable time periods (e.g., years).  COVERAGE \\n GASES AND UNITS • Financial institutions shall account for the seven gases under the Kyoto Protocol that are also mandated under the UNFCCC to be included in national inventories if they are emitted in the value chain. These are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Biogenic CO2 emissions that occur in the value chain shall not be included in the scopes but shall be included and separately reported in the public report. • These seven gases shall be converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) using the 100-year time horizon global warming potentials published by the IPCC; either the AR5 values published by the GHG Protocol60 or the IPCC’s most recently published assessment report.61 • Financial institutions shall express their facilitated emissions in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO2e) or another appropriate metric conversion—e.g., kilotons (ktCO2e), megatons (MtCO2e). When emissions from a specific GHG (e.g., methane emissions) are material and relevant, financial institutions should consider a separate disclosure of these emissions. • Financial institutions shall separately account for, and report, facilitated biogenic and non-biogenic CO2 emissions, and facilitated biogenic and non-biogenic CO2 removals (if applicable).  ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS • Institutions shall disclose the absolute emissions (scope 1 and 2 combined) of their financial activities. If it serves the business goals of the financial institutions, absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions should be reported separately from each other.  ______ 59  Definition according to the GHG Protocol: \"A significance threshold is a qualitative and/or quantitative criterion used to define any significant change to the data, inventory boundaries, methods, or any other relevant factors.\" 60  (GHG Protocol, 2014) 61  The IPCC reports can be found at: https://www.ipcc.ch/. • Financial institutions shall disclose all absolute facilitated emissions for all primary issuance of capital market instruments during the reporting year, in line with the scope defined in Chapter 5, and shall justify any exclusions and be transparent about their resulting coverage in the case of exclusions. Potential justification criteria for exclusion could include, by way of example: - Data availability: required data is not available to the financial institutions. - Size: the activities are insignificant to the institution’s total anticipated facilitated emissions.

Arranger: This term refers to the facilitator roles mentioned below. This may be contrary to market terminology but is the way we chose to describe this activity in Part B of the Standard.  Asset manager: Manages capital and invests it into financial instruments on behalf of clients. In this role, the manager is not the owner of the assets.  Attribution factor: Share of the total annual GHG emissions from facilitated companies and activities associated with the relative share of the capital market issuances.   Bookrunner: The primary underwriter or coordinator when a company or government issues new equity, debt, or securities instruments. The bookrunner is also responsible for structuring the financing, and for designing and implementing the transaction.  Capital markets: This term refers to the venues where funds are exchanged between buyers (capital suppliers) and sellers in the form of equity securities, bonds, or other financial assets. Suppliers in capital markets are typically banks and investors, while those who seek capital are companies and governments.   Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions: The amount of CO2 that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing (a measure for the strength of climate change drivers) over a given time horizon as an emitted amount of another GHG or mixture of GHGs. Conversion factors vary based on the underlying assumptions and as the science advances. As a baseline, PCAF recommends using 100-year global warming potentials without climate-carbon feedback from the most recent IPCC Assessment report.  Co-manager/Lead manager: The secondary underwriter or coordinator when a company or government issues new equity, debt, or securities instruments. The co-manager/lead manager plays a more passive role in the transaction relative to a bookrunner.  Credit facility: A type of loan that borrowers can access on an ongoing basis over an extended period.  Facilitator: An institution that directly or indirectly influences or supports another actor’s capacity to operate/perform/own/dispose of a certain economic activity or product/good or service. The actions that a financial institution may take to influence or support another actor, are subject to different variants specific to each situation/transaction, including, but not limited to, business and legal considerations.   Emission factor: The average mass of CO2 emitted by an entity in one year usually expressed in tCO2/year.  Emission intensity: The average mass of GHG of CO2 emitted by a vehicle when it drives one unit of measure, usually expressed in gCO2/km.  Financed emissions: Absolute emissions that financial institutions finance through their loans and investments.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: The seven gases mandated under the Kyoto Protocol and to be included in national inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). For ease of accounting, these gases are usually converted to and expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).   Investor: A private person or an institutional investor (e.g., pension fund) who invests capital into a financial instrument. They either manage investments alone or delegate this task to an asset manager via a mandate or by investing into an investment fund.  Issuer: The entity (in this Facilitated Emissions Standard involving only corporates) that issues a debt or equity capital markets instrument.  Lead bookrunner: The lead underwriter or coordinator when a company or government issues new equity, debt, or securities instruments. The bookrunner is also responsible for structuring the financing, and for designing and implementing the transaction.  Scope 1 emissions: Direct GHG emissions that occur from sources owned or controlled by the reporting company—i.e., emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.  Scope 2 emissions: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating, or cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 2 emissions physically occur at the facility where the electricity, steam, heating, or cooling is generated.  Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect GHG emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company. Scope 3 can be broken down into upstream emissions that occur in the supply chain (for example, from production or extraction of purchased materials) and downstream emissions that occur because of using the organization’s products or services.  Syndicated loan: Defined as a loan made available by two or more providers under a common loan agreement and ranking credit is assigned upon signature of the loan documentation.

While tracking emission fluctuations and target setting are distinct topics, and not the remit of PCAF as standard, as a point of context, it is worth noting that whether a financial institution applies a 33% weighting, or any other level of weighting to its attributed share of capital markets volumes, the rate of change in overall facilitated emissions reported between time periods should not be impacted. This point is pertinent for target setting and also subsequent reporting against targets. Typically, a financial institution will identify a baseline, from which targets would be established and progress measured. If, by way of example, the target is to reduce facilitated emissions (intensity) purely from the arranging of capital market issuances by 50% by a target year, compared to the baseline year, then the weighting factor is inconsequential to reaching the target. The financial institution will need to halve their facilitated emissions (intensity) no matter what the weighting factor is.

GHG accounting refers to the processes required to consistently measure and report \\nthe amount of GHGs generated, avoided, or removed by an entity, allowing it to track and report \\nthese emissions over time. It enables financial institutions to disclose these emissions at a fixed \\npoint in time and in line with financial accounting periods.\\nUntil now, there has not been a globally accepted standard for measuring and reporting emissions \\nassociated with re/insurance underwriting portfolios (“insurance-associated emissions”). \\nResponding to increasing demand from the insurance industry and other stakeholders, PCAF \\ndeveloped the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for Insurance-Associated \\nEmissions. This new Standard constitutes Part C of PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting and Reporting \\nStandard for the Financial Industry. As such, this Standard supplements the requirements of the \\nGHG Protocol \"Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\" . \\nThis document is the first version of the Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard. It provides \\ndetailed methodological guidance for the measurement and disclosure of GHG emissions \\nassociated with two segments: \\nThe Standard provides detailed guidance for each segment to calculate the insurance-associated \\nemissions resulting from activities in the real economy that are re/insured.

Introduction\\nTHE ROLE OF THE RE/INSURANCE INDUSTRY\\nThe re/insurance industry is one of the largest global industries and a major holder of assets \\nunder management. Total premiums written in life and non-life insurance amount to close to USD \\neight trillion, or 6.8% of global economic output.2\\nThe re/insurance industry plays an important role in supporting the transition to a low-emission \\neconomy. As institutional investors, re/insurers can invest in zero- and low-emission technologies \\nand engage with their investee companies on their decarbonization pathways. As professional \\nrisk managers, re/insurers can help communities understand, prevent, and reduce climate risk. \\nAs professional risk carriers, re/insurers protect businesses, households, public entities, and \\ngovernments by absorbing economic shocks due to weather-related risks such as cyclones, \\nfloods, extreme heat, and droughts. For their own operations, re/insurers can set their own climate \\npolicies and influence low-emissions goods and services.\\nDemand from the re/insurance industry and other stakeholders for tools to measure and report \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is increasing. As such, there is a need to develop a set of global, \\nstandardised methodologies for measuring and disclosing the GHG emissions associated with re/\\ninsurance underwriting portfolios for accounting purposes (throughout the document referred to \\nas insurance-associated emissions).\\nTHE ROLE OF PCAF AND GHG EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING IN REPORTING, \\nMANAGING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENSURING COMPATIBILITY OF \\nFINANCIAL FLOWS WITH THE PARIS AGREEMENT\\nThe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is an industry-led initiative which was \\ncreated in 2015 by 14 Dutch financial institutions. In 2018 PCAF expanded into North America and \\nwent global in September 2019. PCAF aims to standardise the way financial institutions measure \\nand report financed emissions, facilitated emissions, and insurance-associated emissions. In \\naddition, it aims to increase the number of financial institutions that commit to measuring and \\ndisclosing these scope 3 emissions in line with the methods it develops.\\nIn 2020, the first edition of the \"Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial \\nIndustry\" covering financed emissions (“Financed Emissions Standard”) was published.3 This \\nstandard is built upon the GHG Protocol standards for corporate reporting. It has been reviewed \\nby the GHG Protocol and is in conformance with the requirements set forth in the \"Corporate \\nValue Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\" for category 15 investment activities.\\nSince then, banks and investors have asked to expand the standard with more methods, also covering \\nother avtivities of the financial industry. From 2021 onwards, PCAF started the work on three parts \\nunder the umbrella of the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry:\\n2 Sigma No 4/2022, World insurance, Swiss Re\\n3 PCAF (2020): The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

PCAF’s Financed Emissions Standard4 covers methodologies for \\nmeasuring and reporting the GHG emissions associated with loans and investments, known as \\nfinanced emissions. For their asset owner and management activities, re/insurers can use this \\nexisting Financed Emissions Standard subject to their existing regulatory requirements.\\nThe core difference between financed and insurance-associated emissions is the nature of the \\nrelationship of the financial institution with the client (see Chapter 4.2 for more details).  \\nA re/insurer’s Property and Casualty (P&C) lines of business (LoB) transfer risks associated with \\neconomic activity but do not finance the activity nor imply any form of ownership. A re/insurer \\nholds no capital interest in the primary insurance customer’s operations, and no financial or direct \\noperational control is exerted.5\\nThe lack of ownership or direct control over the customer’s activity impacts the influence a  \\nre/insurer will have on the decisions made by the customer to reduce the associated emissions. \\nHowever, even without this ownership interest, a re/insurer may influence a customer’s activities. \\nThe ability of a customer to engage in its specific business activity is limited without the support \\nof insurance. In other words, re/insurance enables a customer’s business activities.\\nABOUT THIS DOCUMENT: STANDARDIZING GHG EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING \\nFOR RE/INSURANCE\\nThis document is the first version of the \"Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard \\nfor Insurance-Associated Emissions\".

GHG accounting in re/insurance\\nWHAT IS GHG ACCOUNTING?\\nGHG emissions accounting (“GHG accounting”) refers to the processes required to consistently \\nmeasure the amount of GHGs generated, avoided or removed by an entity, allowing it to track \\nand report these emissions over time. The emissions measured are the seven gases mandated \\nunder the Kyoto Protocol and to be included in national inventories under the United Nations \\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), \\nnitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride \\n(SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). For ease of accounting, these gases are usually converted to \\nand expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).\\nGHG accounting is most commonly used by governments, corporations, and other entities to \\nmeasure the direct and indirect emissions that occur throughout their value chains as a result of \\norganizational and business activities. According to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and \\nReporting Standard,10 direct emissions are emissions from sources owned or controlled by the \\nreporting company. Indirect emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the operations of \\nthe reporting company, but that occur at sources owned or controlled by another company.\\nDirect and indirect emissions are further categorised by scope and distinguished according to the \\nsource of the emissions and where in an organization’s value chain the emissions occur. The three \\nscopes defined by the GHG Protocol—scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3—are briefly described below \\nand are illustrated in Figure 2-1.\\n• Scope 1 : Direct GHG emissions that occur from sources owned or controlled by the reporting \\ncompany—i.e., emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.\\n• Scope 2 : Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, \\nsteam, heating, or cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 2 emissions \\nphysically occur at the facility where the electricity, steam, heating, or cooling is generated.\\n• Scope 3 : All other indirect GHG emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the \\nvalue chain of the reporting company. Scope 3 can be broken down into upstream \\nemissions that occur in the supply chain (for example, from production or extraction of \\npurchased materials) and downstream emissions that occur as a consequence of using the \\norganization’s products or services.  \\nThe GHG Protocol \"Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\"11  \\ncategorises scope 3 emissions into 15 categories, as shown in Figure 2-1. According to the GHG \\nProtocol, accounting and reporting on emissions associated with a reporting company’s insurance \\nunderwriting activities are optional under scope 3 category 15 (Investments, other investments \\nor financial services ). The Working Group proposes that insurance-associated emissions are \\nreported as a supplementary accounting note within the re/insurers’ scope 3 category 15 \\n(Investments).

GHG accounting is a necessary step for organisations to better understand \\nand manage their emissions. For a re/insurer, scope 3 category 15 emissions – financed emissions \\nand insurance-associated emissions – are the most significant part of its indirect GHG emissions \\ninventory. Special consideration must therefore be made to how these are measured. Measuring \\ninsurance-associated emissions is an important step a re/insurer can take to identify and assess \\nclimate-related transition risks and identify potential opportunities.\\nGHG ACCOUNTING HELPS MEASURE THREE TYPES OF CLIMATE IMPACT: \\nGENERATED EMISSIONS, EMISSION REMOVALS, AND AVOIDED EMISSIONS\\nGHG accounting is the annual corporate accounting and disclosure of insurance-associated \\nemissions in (parts of) the portfolio of a re/insurer at a fixed point in time and in line with financial \\naccounting periods. Insurance-associated emissions can be measured as the amounts of GHGs \\ngenerated, avoided, or removed by an insured institution.\\nThe volume of absolute emitted GHG emissions of an insured that is subsequently associated \\nwith a re/insurance company for the purposes of GHG accounting is commonly referred to as the \\ninsured’s generated (absolute) emissions.\\nNot all underwriting activities are associated with generated insurance-associated emissions. \\nRe/insurance covers can also contribute to the deployment of emission removal solutions that \\nabsorb CO2e from the atmosphere and store it in durable materials, terrestrial carbon sinks, \\nor in geological reservoirs deep underground.

Other examples are P&C covers for machinery that filters \\nCO2e directly from the atmosphere and transforms it into carbonate minerals locked inside \\nconcrete blocks. The volume of CO2e absorbed and durably stored is considered an emission \\nremoval  that can also be quantified and reported.\\nCarbon removal activities will become important to achieve global net zero, namely to net-out \\n(balance) residual emissions. Currently, though, there are no international rules for negative \\nemissions accounting. Final guidance by the GHG Protocol on emissions removals is expected \\nto be published in 2023.12 While PCAF acknowledges that emissions removals are integral to \\ncombatting climate change,13 this Standard does not provide guidance on how to measure \\nand report insurance-associated emissions removals. For the time being, PCAF refers to the \\nforthcoming guidance from the GHG Protocol. Future versions of this Standard may potentially \\ninclude more specific guidance on emissions removals.\\nLastly, emissions accounting in the real economy sometimes compares actual emissions of a \\nzero- or low-emission project (project emissions) to the hypothetical emissions of high-emission \\nalternatives (baseline emissions). The difference between the two is referred to as avoided \\nemissions.  Insurance-associated avoided emissions could be calculated and accounted for in \\nthe same way. The working group for PCAF’s financed emissions standard had also suggested \\nspecific guidance for avoided emissions accounting, limited to a particular asset class (project \\nfinance) and project type (renewable electricity).\\nReporting avoided emissions is an attempt by companies to demonstrate a quantifiable positive \\ncontribution to decarbonization, albeit based on predictions of baseline emissions that are \\ndifficult to delimit and have suffered from systematic overestimation in the past.14 A more direct \\nway to understand a company’s contribution to decarbonization follows from the trend in the \\ngenerated (absolute) emissions data reported over time. Consequently, the Working Group has \\ndecided not to provide specific guidance on insurance-associated avoided emissions. \\nRe/insurers may report on emission removals and on avoided emissions. They shall always do so \\nseparately from the re/insurer’s scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG inventories and report their methodological \\nformula for calculating these types of emissions (i.e., emission removals and avoided emissions) in \\naccordance with the guidance contained in Chapter 6.\\nEMISSIONS METRICS IN THE CONTEXT OF INSURANCE-ASSOCIATED EMISSIONS  \\nDifferent emissions metrics can be used for different purposes and some key  \\ninsurance-associated emissions metrics and their merits are discussed in Table 6-1 “Emission \\nmetrics for the context of insurance-associated emissions,” in Chapter 6; this is not exhaustive.\\n12 The GHG Protocol’s ‘Land Sector and Removals Guidance’ is currently being developed through a multi-stakeholder development \\nprocess.

GHG accounting can be used as a basis \\nto achieve business goals\\nThe existing PCAF Financed Emissions Standard highlights four of the major business goals \\nthat financial institutions can pursue in the context of their sustainability and climate-related \\nstrategies that GHG accounting could support (see Figure 3-1). This set of business goals is \\nvoluntary in nature and by no means exhaustive.\\nIn this chapter, these business goals are recast in terms of re/insurance. The effectiveness or \\nability of re/insurers to put in place such business goals may be restricted by factors such as the \\nmandatory/compulsory nature of some LoB in certain jurisdictions, the influence of government-\\nbacked schemes across certain LoB in certain jurisdictions, regulatory requirements, credit rating \\nconcerns, and/or the business strategies of individual re/insurance companies.\\nUnderstanding the climate impact of underwriting portfolios makes good business sense for a \\nre/insurer. GHG accounting can help re/insurers achieve multiple objectives, such as creating \\ntransparency for stakeholders, managing financial risks associated with climate policies and \\nregulations, creating new insurance products to support decarbonization efforts, and ensuring \\nthat their own underwriting portfolios are compatible with the Paris Agreement as appropriate.\\nFigure 3-1.

Other re/insurers may want to structure their inventories in a way \\nthat helps them track their insurance-associated emissions reduction goals, where relevant, year \\nover year.

In response to demand and the consensus that climate change poses a considerable \\nthreat to the global economy, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) launched the industry-led \\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2015. The TCFD framework15 has \\nexpanded since its recommendations were launched in 2017 to provide further guidance on how \\ncompanies may report their climate-related risks and opportunities. At the time of the publication \\nof this Standard, TCFD-recommended disclosures are mostly voluntary. In certain jurisdictions \\nthey have become mandatory. However, with strong backing from central banks, the Supervisors’ \\nNetwork for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and the industry itself, companies will likely \\nbe faced with new regulatory requirements with respect to transparency.\\nFor re/insurers, a key facet of TCFD disclosure relates to their underwriting activities. This \\nis recognised by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which – in aligning with the TCFD \\nframework – adapted its 2020 climate questionnaire for the financial sector to include a section \\non the reporting of scope 3 category 15 (Investment) emissions. This also includes re/insurance \\ncompanies in their capacity as asset managers. As discussed in Chapter 2, insurance-associated \\nemissions should therefore be reported as a supplementary note to scope 3 category 15 \\n(Investment) emissions for accounting purposes. They should not be aggregated with financed \\nemissions.\\nAnother emerging disclosure framework is the Exposure Draft of IFRS S2 on Climate-related \\nDisclosures (Climate Exposure Draft) of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).16\\nCreating transparency for internal stakeholders can also be a business goal pursued by re/\\ninsurers. Carrying out an assessment of insurance-associated emissions gives a re/insurer’s \\nboard and senior management a better picture of their organization’s impact on the climate. By \\nmeasuring and disclosing insurance-associated emissions and thereby creating opportunities for \\nclimate disclosure, re/insurers can define their own role and also that of the industry more broadly \\nin combatting climate change.\\nBUSINESS GOAL 2: MANAGE CLIMATE-RELATED TRANSITION RISKS\\nIncreasingly, re/insurers are building an understanding of the exposure of their underwriting \\nportfolios to risks posed by climate-related policies and regulations. GHG accounting helps these \\ninstitutions independently identify areas of their underwriting activities that fall under  \\ncarbon-intensive sectors. Such underwriting activities could be impacted in the future, for example, \\nby the introduction of carbon prices and policies and regulations that are aimed at reducing emissions.\\nRe/insurers that do not report their climate-related risks could potentially face reputational risk, \\nespecially if peers are increasingly doing so. Measuring and disclosing insurance-associated \\nemissions is a way for re/insurers to further manage their climate-related reputational risk.\\n15 (TCFD, 2017), Publications | Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (fsb-tcfd.org)\\n16 More information can be found at: IFRS - Climate-related Disclosures', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The relationship between re/insurers and the insureds\\nLiving life and running businesses involves risks. To mitigate these risks, individuals and \\ncompanies buy insurance. They transfer a portion of the risk they face to insurers and pay a \\npremium. When the insured event occurs, the insurer pays out as defined in the terms and \\nconditions of the insurance policy. Insurers then too buy insurance (reinsurance) to transfer \\npart of the risks on their balance sheet to reinsurers.  \\nSeveral characteristics differentiate the relationship between re/insurers and their insurance \\nclients from the relationship between investors/banks and their clients, including the following:\\n• Claims payments can be characterised as a money flow. However, re/insurance proceeds \\nare not an investment or loan, as the right to proceeds is contingent on the occurrence \\nof a re/insured event. While a re/insurance policy can and does support economic \\nexpansion and growth, the specific claims payments (the money) are intended for \\nrecovery, and not expansion or enrichment.\\n• The re/insurance contract relationship creates no ownership or transfer of equity/loan \\nand results in no financial or direct operational control. Re/insurance contracts represent \\nan expression of commitment and trust – that is, the re/insurer will provide the agreed \\ncoverage should the terms of the re/insurance contract be fulfilled. While this coverage  \\nis often financial, it may also include services such as legal, security, and claims \\nremediation in the case of, for example, environmental and cyber claims.\\n• A re/insurer/insured relationship is also formed differently than the relationship between \\nan investor/investee. That is, investors choose the client in which to make an investment. \\nThe client ultimately chooses the re/insurer, often introduced through an intermediary \\nsuch as a broker/agent.\\n• The length of the contractual relationship for most P&C re/insurance lines is usually one year.  \\nRe/insurers are enablers in the sense that they have the opportunity to directly or \\nindirectly influence or suppo rt another actor’s capacity to operate/perform/own/dispose \\nof a certain economic activity or product/good or service. The actions that a re/insurer \\nmay take to possibly influence or support another actor, are subject to different variants \\nspecific to each situation/transaction, including, but not limited to, business and legal \\nconsiderations. For example, if the provision of insurance for certain LoB is mandatory in \\na given jurisdiction, an insurer may only be able to engage with a client but not change \\nanything about the provision of cover which is set by law. In this case, the actions a  \\nre/insurer can take are relatively limited.  \\nMoreover, several private companies and government activities can be characterised \\nas enablers. For example, in the motor vehicle value chain enabling actors could be the \\nfollowing: the state agencies, motor vehicles manufacturers, lending institutions, re/\\ninsurance companies, dealers, maintenance services, gas stations, or repairers. All are \\nplayers in the motor value chain. Also, within the insurance industry, several actors can \\npotentially have influence, depending on their involvement in each situation/transaction, \\nincluding primary insurers, reinsurers and brokers.

It \\nmeans that the money should be followed as far as possible to understand and account for the \\nclimate impact that financial assets have in the real economy. Due to the different nature of the \\nrelationship with the client in re/insurance underwriting (see section on “Recognition”), PCAF \\nrefers to the “follow the risk” rather than “follow the money” principle in the case of insurance-\\nassociated emissions.\\nThe “follow the risk” principle implies looking at the insured whose risk is transferred to the re/\\ninsurance industry. The “follow the risk” principle looks at the risk transfer, while the “follow the \\nmoney” principle applicable to financed emissions looks at money flows. In case of “follow the \\nrisk”, the entity whose emissions are in focus typically is the insured. The insured party is not \\nnecessarily the one receiving the insurance payout. In the case of third-party liability, for instance, \\nthe insurance recoverable ultimately serves to indemnify the third party that has been damaged \\nby the policyholder.\\nRe/insurers that intend to conform to this Standard shall measure and report their insurance-\\nassociated emissions using the methodologies set out in this Standard, covering the seven GHGs \\nrequired under the Kyoto Protocol. As a minimum, absolute GHG insurance-associated emissions \\nresulting from underwriting activities (scope 3 category 15 emissions) in the reporting year shall \\nbe measured and reported as a supplementary accounting note and shall not be aggregated with \\nfinanced emissions. In addition, and when relevant, emission removals and avoided emissions may \\nbe measured and shall be reported separately. Absent specific guidance in the first version of this \\nStandard on both emission removals and avoided emissions, re/insurers shall disclose separately \\nthe methodological formula adopted in calculating emissions removed or avoided in accordance \\nwith the guidance in Chapter 6.\\nAs a basis for reporting emissions, re/insurers shall choose a fixed point in time to determine their \\nunderwriting positions and calculate an attribution factor. This point in time could be, for instance, \\nthe last day of their fiscal year (e.g., June 30 or December 31). The GHG accounting period shall \\nalign with the financial accounting period.\\nATTRIBUTION\\nAssessing the attribution for financed emissions of commercial clients is relatively straightforward \\nbecause the total capital of a company is known from the liability side of company’s balance \\nsheet. Conversely, this is more difficult for the re/insurance industry when assessing the \\nattribution of GHG emissions of both firms and households/individual customers.\\nThe \"GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\" \\nprovides guidance for GHG emissions from loans and investments. They should be allocated to \\nthe reporting financial institutions based on the proportional share of lending or investment in \\nthe borrower or investee.26 A similar logic should be applied to insurance-associated emissions, \\namended to reflect the distinct relationship between a re/insurer and their customer.\\n26 (WRI and WBCSD, 2011)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Insurance-associated emissions and double counting\\nDouble counting, which occurs when GHG emissions are counted more than once in the \\ninventory of insurance-associated emissions of one or more insurance companies, should \\nbe avoided as much as possible. Double counting of insurance-associated emissions can \\noccur due to several reasons:\\n• Double counting between insurance and asset management activities  \\nInsurance companies perform both underwriting and asset management activities. \\nBoth insurance-associated and financed emissions are a form of virtual accounting for \\nreal economy GHG emissions. They offer a different view on the cube of “real” GHG \\nemissions (see Figure 5-1). When investing in and insuring the same company, the \\nemissions of this company are double counted by the insurance company. This can be \\navoided by separately reporting financed emissions for investments and insurance-\\nassociated emissions for insurance underwriting\\n• Double counting across emission scopes  \\nInsurers may offer cover to several companies along a value chain. This can lead to \\ndouble counting of the insured’s emissions within the insurance-associated emissions. \\nThis effect can be limited by reporting insured’ scope 3 emissions separately from \\nscope 1 and 2 emissions of insured clients as required by this Standard. However, there \\nmay still be double counting with respect to scope 1 and 2 of insured clients when \\ninsuring both power-generating companies and their clients.\\n• Double counting between different insurers of the same client or between the \\nprimary insurers and reinsurers  \\nAs certain risks are too large to be borne by an individual re/insurer, these risks \\ncan be spread in a complex risk-sharing system comprising many players, including \\ninsurance, reinsurance (“insurance of an insurance policy/portfolio”), and retrocession \\n(“reinsurance of a reinsurance policy/portfolio”). The consequent risk of double \\ncounting of emissions between those players could be addressed by reporting net \\ninsurance-associated emissions (i.e., calculated based on net re/insurance premium).  \\nDouble counting is a frequent and inherent aspect of GHG accounting. It does not need to \\nbe seen problematic, if:\\n• double counting does not interfere with stated decarbonization goals of getting a clear \\nview on where portfolios are connected to their customer’s and investee’s emissions; and\\n• methodologies and limitations are stated transparently as part of the disclosure.\\nPCAF’s objective will not be to eradicate double counting and to create a global balance \\nsheet of absolute GHG emissions. The ambition will be, to minimise double counting \\nconcerns where they impact stated principles and the delivery of a transparent and \\nconsistent approach to track and report insurance-associated emissions and their \\nchanges over time. Re/insurance companies using the methodologies of this Standard \\nwill be subject to the same exposure to double counting and will not be more significantly \\naffected than others.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Where data quality is low, re/insurers can design approaches to improve it  \\nover time.\\nFor measuring insurance-associated emissions in each line of business, various data inputs are \\nneeded to calculate the re/insurer’s attribution factor and the client’s total emissions. The data \\nneeded to calculate an attribution factor can typically come from the re/insurer and its clients, \\nalthough the data required to calculate the client’s emissions might not be readily available and \\nmust be sought out by the re/insurer. For emissions associated with commercial lines portfolios, \\na simple template has been created for the purpose of capturing at source the core data required \\nby re/insurers for calculating emissions associated with commercial lines portfolios (see Appendix \\n5).

Methodology to measure insurance-\\nassociated emissions\\nThis chapter describes the methods to calculate insurance-associated emissions for two segments:\\n \\nEach segment has its own section covering methodology including guidance on the following elements:\\n• Emission scopes covered\\n• Attribution of emissions\\n• Formulas to calculate insurance-associated emissions\\n• Data required\\n• Limitations\\n \\nThis is an initial list of segments covered by PCAF. The initiative intends to both update the \\nmethodologies over time and add additional ones. Developing an accurate, comparable, feasible \\nand broad-based standard covering numerous segments will be an iterative process.  \\n \\n5.1 General considerations  \\nThis Standard defines attribution factors that reflect an adequate share of emissions for insurance. \\nIt is calculated based on data that is readily available, such as premiums and the costs/revenues of a \\ncompany or a specific insured asset. The approaches for commercial and personal motor insurance \\nportfolios are based on a conceptually similar idea: the attribution factor is determined based on the  \\nimportance of insurance as production factor for the insured asset or company. However, this does \\nnot mean the two approaches deliver comparable absolute values and hence, the emissions for  \\ncommercial lines and personal motor should be reported separately. For commercial portfolios, the ratio  \\nof premiums and revenues of a company is used to determine attribution. For motor, the attribution \\nis calculated based on the share of insurance in the total cost of ownership of running a vehicle.\\nThere are several other approaches to define meaningful attribution factors for re/insurance \\nwhich have been discussed in the Working Group (see also the Progress Report for full details).27\\nIf an insurance cover is mandatory, it could be argued that all emissions of a company or an asset \\nneed to be allocated to the insurer, because a company could not operate without the insurance cover. \\nProblems could arise, for example, in circumstances where a company needs to take out multiple \\nmandatory insurance covers. In addition to mandatory coverage, other prerequisites for the activity \\noften need to be fulfilled. For example, for vehicles not only insurance is required to drive the car, but \\nalso the vehicle’s registration or fuel. Ultimately, there can be multiple contributors that enable the \\nactivity to take place. The adequate shares of all contributors must therefore be considered.\\n27 More information can be found at: https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/2022-07/2207-insurancestandard-03.\\npdf?899cf30b3c.pdfCommercial lines Personal motor lines', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This option is not practical, particularly for households/individuals, due to \\nlack of data. It would show that only a fraction of emissions of a company, household/individual, or an \\nasset would be allocated to an insurance company or the whole insurance industry.\\nFigure 5-1: Total cost of risk of a company\\nRisk identification\\nRisk assessment\\nRisk avoidance\\nRisk mitigationRisk management costs \\nRetained losses\\nLoss adjustments\\nCapital costs\\nCompliance  Risk retention costs\\nPremiums\\nTaxes\\nBrokerageRisk transfer costsRisk management Self-insurance Insurance\\n Source: Swiss Re Institute sigma No 05/2012\\n \\nAnother option is that a company’s balance sheet could be expanded to include the additional \\nequity or debt that theoretically would be required to substitute for the insurance products \\npurchased. Based on this calculation, the insurer’s share of a company’s emissions could be \\ncalculated in the same way as financed emissions. The share of debt and equity holder’s financed \\nemissions would be reduced respectively, while the insurer will take its fraction of the company’s \\nfinanced emissions. While this approach would be consistent with the approach for financed \\nemissions it is not feasible to implement.\\nMost of these theoretical reflections, though not feasible to be implemented, show that it is \\nadequate that only a fraction of total emissions are allocated to the insurance sector. This is also \\nreflected by the approaches defined. For example, as global commercial insurance premiums \\naccount for an estimated 0.5% of global gross revenues of all economic sectors,28 this share \\nof emissions would roughly be allocated to the insurance sector. However, the importance of \\npersonal motor insurance versus the total cost of ownership for a vehicle is higher, in the range of \\n10% to 26% globally.29\\n28 Based on Swiss Re sigma and Oxford Economics data.\\n29 Based on PCAF research.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

While the products purchased by those entities \\nare broadly identical to products available to business entities, defining the boundaries for the \\nemissions to be associated for public entities requires additional methodological work. These will \\nbe covered in future versions of the Standard, potentially leveraging ongoing work for financed \\nemissions from sovereign bonds.\\nFor the time being, this Standard does not consider other personal lines (e.g., homeowner \\ninsurance), any life or health insurance (including corporate life and pensions) and personal \\naccident. The approach for commercial insurance portfolios shall be applied to facultative \\nreinsurance. However, this Standard does not cover treaty reinsurance and other treaty-like \\nreinsurance programs in commercial lines and personal motor (e.g., facultative-obligatory treaties, \\nfacultative facilities), mostly due to data availability constraints, but the box below presents initial \\nthoughts.\\n \\nBox 5-1. Why is treaty reinsurance excluded from the first version of the Standard?\\nFacultative reinsurance contracts typically cover a single risk or block of risks of one \\ninsured entity or company. Facultative covers therefore have similar characteristics as \\ndirect insurance policies and hence fall into the scope of this Standard. This does not apply \\nto reinsurance treaties. These can take many forms and structures, but typically provide \\ncover for contractually defined risks associated with a portfolio of business within a specific \\nclass of insurance assumed by insurers and ceded to reinsurers in bulk. For reinsurance \\ntreaties which follow a per-risk approach (the risk typically being the original insured asset \\nor company rather than a specific peril), a bottom-up calculation of the attribution factor is \\n(theoretically) still feasible. However, the required data to calculate insurance-associated \\nemissions is in practice not available to the reinsurer. The situation is even more complex for \\nevent or aggregate-cover treaties, where a bottom-up calculation is not possible, not even \\ntheoretically.\\nThe second version of the Standard aims to address the issue of data availability \\nand consistency across the entire re/insurance value chain, and define an attribution \\nmethodology for reinsurance associated with treaty reinsurance aligned with PCAF principles.\\nA sub-working group continuing the work on this important topic has already been \\nestablished.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Instead, data at the entity level (parent \\nor subsidiary) shall be used. This requirement is based on major asset specific LoBs (e.g., \\nconstruction all risk & erection all risk) being out of scope of the current version of the Standard, \\nthe chosen commercial attribution factor and the lack of an insurance industry wide definition \\nof the term asset in the context of asset based insurance coverage. These topics will need to be \\naddressed in a future version of the Standard.\\nIn cases where policies cover specific subsidiaries of a company, the insurance-associated \\nemissions can be calculated to account solely for these. However, this may only be done if the \\nrelevant revenue and emission data are available at an adequate level of granularity. Data can be \\navailable on a reported or estimated basis. The use of estimated data will impact the quality score \\nof the resulting attributed emissions. A mismatch of the organizational scope in the attribution \\nfactor and the emissions side of the equation must be avoided.

These topics will \\nneed to be addressed in a future version of the Standard.\\nPCAF acknowledges that using data at an entity level (parent or subsidiary) to measure the \\ninsurance-associated emissions of specific insured activities, locations, or projects may lead to \\na less accurate or specific measurement of emissions. In order to reflect this, whenever using \\nparent-company-level data or data related to a higher entity relative to the insured project, asset \\nor subsidiary, the resulting insurance-associated emissions will be assigned a lower quality score. \\nAn example of this is using parent company-reported verified emissions data and revenue in \\norder to estimate emissions associated with an insured project or asset: this will be awarded score \\n4 instead of score 1. Similarly, if company verified emissions and production output is known and \\nused to estimate the emissions associated with the insured asset or project, this will be awarded \\nscore 4 instead of score 3.\\nQuality scoring  \\nPCAF distinguishes three options with six sub-options to calculate the insurance-associated \\nemissions from commercial policies depending on the data used. If a re/insurer uses a mix of \\noptions to calculate the emissions of an insured entity (e.g., actual verified emission is known and \\nonly an average revenue/proxy is used to calculate attribution factor, which means that Option 1a \\nand Option 3b are mixed), the data score for the lower-rated option should be assumed for this \\ninsured (i.e., score 5 from Option 3b).\\nAs scope 1 and 2 emissions will be reported combined, data quality scoring will be applied to \\nboth scopes jointly. Data quality scoring will be applied separately to scope 3 emissions data if \\nreported. Since scope 1 and 2 emissions can have different methods of estimation, the combined \\ndata quality score to be reported shall be the lowest of the two methods.\\n \\nLIMITATIONS\\nExposure to market volatility  \\nBoth re/insurance premium and customer revenue are exposed to volatility due to insurance \\nmarket cycles and general macroeconomic market movements, which can be decoupled from \\nchanges in real world GHG emissions. For example, a surge in energy prices would lead to lower \\ninsurance-associated emissions, and an increase in loss activity factored into re/insurance \\npremiums over time could lead to increased insurance-associated emissions, even if neither \\nthe insured’s emissions nor the provided insurance cover has changed. This could lead to \\ncounterintuitive developments of insurance-associated emissions, requiring extra efforts for a  \\nre/insurer to understand and appropriately explain those dynamics in their reporting.\\nGeneralised nature of Option 3  \\nOne limitation of Option 3 is the generalised nature and necessary assumptions made in applying \\nregion- or sector-specific average values, both for emissions and financial data.

By adequately \\nabating the risks for the insured, the insured activities are also enabled—that is, the ability to \\noperate the vehicle.

However, for motor vehicle insurance to businesses (in particular for \\ninsurance of company-owned staff cars), companies often collect information on actual fuel consumption or distance travelled \\nand could share such information with re/insurers.\\n54 Emission intensity of a vehicle is either declared/collected from the customer or matched in a country-specific vehicle emission \\ndatabase using a vehicle identification number (VIN) or a country vehicle registration/ identifier.\\n55 Vehicle make and model refers to the name of the company that manufactures the vehicle and the product name of the vehicle. \\nFor example, Toyota Prius.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For the US and Canada, state- or province-level distance travelled per year can be \\nretrieved from carinsurance.com and the Canadian Office of Energy Efficiency.\\nPCAF’s web-based emission factor database provides emission factors per vehicle type (e.g., \\npassenger car) and per vehicle make and model for a large set of geographies.

As there is no industry \\nstandard on naming vehicles, vehicle matching using make and model as a proxy can give rise \\nto inconsistencies. Hence, PCAF recommends that re/insurers collect the actual vehicle make \\nand model and other vehicle information such as engine type and efficiency to determine the \\nexact vehicle to match in emission factor database. If the re/insurer does not track the vehicle \\nmake and model, PCAF recommends that the re/insurer falls back to a generic vehicle type (e.g., \\npassenger car, motorcycle, light commercial truck) or to an average vehicle as a last resort (where  \\nemission intensity is determined by the weighted average vehicle efficiency in the respective \\ngeography).\\nElectric vehicles and electricity grid estimates\\nFor electric vehicles, emission intensity can be derived using the electricity consumption intensity \\n(using the same data sourcing methods as emission intensity) and the electricity grid emission \\nfactor.

The requirements \\nand recommendations are supplementary to and build upon the reporting requirements set out \\nby the \"GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard\".\\nAll re/insurers that decide to adopt and use this Standard shall follow the requirements therein \\nwhen publicly disclosing their insurance-associated emissions. They have the flexibility to decide \\nwhere they want to start with measuring and disclosing their insurance-associated emissions—for \\ninstance, at a specific line of business level or by sector. Flexibility in reporting is allowed largely \\nas a consequence of limitations in data availability and quality. PCAF recognises that data for \\nmany insureds may not be available to re/insurers and that insureds may not consistently disclose \\ntheir emissions or emissions arising from an insured activity.\\nThe requirements for disclosure of insurance-associated emissions describe a minimum \\ndisclosure level with flexibility for re/insurers to report more. Any requirements not fulfilled must \\nbe explained. Minimum reporting requirements are described in this chapter using the word \\n“shall”.

Illustrative example of the incompatibility of aggregating financed emissions \\nand insurance-associated emissions\\nRe/insurance companies are exposed to the emissions associated with their investment \\nportfolios (as asset managers), and emissions associated with their re/insurance portfolios \\n(as re/insurers).\\nThe relationship between a re/insurer and their client is fundamentally different from the \\nrelationship between an investor and their investee. Insurers lack ownership of, or direct \\ncontrol over, the activities of insureds. The attribution factors applied across the financed \\nemissions and insurance-associated emissions workstreams therefore necessarily differ to \\nreflect the difference in the underlying relationship.\\nAlthough for the purposes of their GHG inventories, both financed emissions and \\ninsurance-associated emissions are “downstream” scope 3 emissions of a re/insurance \\ncompany, the output of financed emissions and insurance-associated emissions \\ncalculations are not aligned and will diverge significantly. There is a real risk that, in \\naggregating the output of financed emissions and insurance-associated emissions, re/\\ninsurers risk: (i) double counting their attributed emissions impact; and (ii) misleading \\nthe end-user of their reporting. Where reported separately, this distinction can be clearly \\ndrawn and the disclosures appropriately caveated. It is therefore recommended that \\ninsurance-associated emissions be reported as a supplementary accounting note to scope \\n3 category 15 (Investments).\\nThe following examples demonstrate the difference between the “Follow the money” and \\n“Follow the risk” principles for a re/insurer when separately considering the emissions \\nassociated with its investment and re/insurance relationships:\\n“Follow the money”:\\n1. Insured A pays premium to insurer\\n2. Insurer issues a policy of insurance to Insured A\\n3. Insurer invests a proportion of premium in Company B\\n4.

The attribution factor depends on the financing type and source, but represents \\nthe principle that the insurer has the potential to benefit economically from the \\nactivities of Company B\\n“Follow the risk”: \\n1. Insured A pays premium to insurer\\n2. Insurer issues a policy of insurance to Insured A\\n3. Insurer reserves a proportion of premium to pay valid claims made by Insured A\\n4. Insured A has direct scope 1 and indirect scope 2 emissions\\n5.

Illustrative example on the benefits of reporting relative together with \\nabsolute insurance-associated emissions\\n”Absolute insurance-associated emissions” refer to the volume of GHG emissions of an \\ninsured that are subsequently associated with a re/insurance company for the purposes of \\nGHG accounting. Calculation of absolute emissions provides re/insurers with a necessary \\nbaseline from which they can set their decarbonization trajectories. Absolute emissions \\nare independent of diluting business metrics, and reflect real-world changes in emissions. \\nThere is an expectation that absolute emissions data will become more readily available \\nover time as reporting requirements increasingly require its disclosure. This should help \\nimprove data quality over time.\\n“Relative insurance-associated emissions” refer to absolute emissions that have been \\nnormalised (i.e., divided) by another variable, such as revenue.

This growing \\nmomentum is matched by the fast-rising number of initiatives, projects, \\nmethods and tools to enable financial institutions to achieve Paris alignment. \\nIn this growing and complex landscape of climate finance activities, FIs need a \\nstandardized language to define common terms and need more clarity on how \\nthese activities relate to each other. \\nFinancial institutions of all sizes, regions and levels of progress must be able to understand this \\nlandscape of activities and use commonly accepted, agreed-upon language to effectively scale and \\ncommunicate their climate efforts and identify the most efficient support available to do so. \\nThis Strategic Framework intends to provide clarity to financial institutions seeking alignment with \\nthe Paris Agreement through three main components:\\n1.  A clear explanation of the technical elements of Paris alignment for financial institutions,\\n2.  The definition of consistent terminologies as used in the process of Paris alignment, and \\n3.  A map of existing initiatives, projects, methods and tools to identify the possible synergies in the  \\n    process of Paris alignment for financial institutions.\\n1. Paris Agreement Goals to Achieve Net Zero by 2050\\nThe Paris Agreement was reached in 2015 with the express aim of pursuing efforts to limit global \\ntemperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly \\nreduce the risks and impacts of climate change.1 Achieving this goal requires global emissions to \\ndecline by about 50% relative to 2010 levels by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050.2\\nLevel of ambition\\nThe level of ambition to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and steer global emissions \\ntowards net zero in 2050 is enormous and differs per sector. Financial institutions play a crucial \\nrole in facilitating this transition by steering their financed emissions towards net-zero goals: one \\nof the three key goals of the Paris Agreement is to direct the scale and speed of global financial \\nflows to match the required path to very low-emission, climate-resilient development.3 Buy-in from \\nthe financial industry is of critical importance because its power to reallocate capital and finance \\nthe transition can catalyse rapid decarbonization across all sectors. Monitoring an FIs’ financed \\nemissions plays an essential role in holding FIs accountable in  a consistent and transparent way, \\nensuring that the actions taken by the financial sector result in real impact.\\n1 UNFCCC, The Paris Agreement, 2015.\\n2 IPCC, 2018: Global Warming of 1.5°C.

Feedback to this \\nconsultation indicated an urgent need for global sustainability standards and strong support for \\nthe IFRS Foundation to play a role in their development. In response, the IFRS Foundation Trustees \\nannounced in March 2021 the formation of a working group dedicated to the technical preparation \\nfor a potential international sustainability reporting standards board.14\\nFinally, the ISO 14097 standard currently under development aims to provide a framework for \\nassessing the impact of financiers’ actions.\\nProjects and tools\\nMany projects and tools provide data and analytical capability to support FIs on their climate \\njourney to Paris alignment.

The Annex provides a \\nfull overview of global projects, methodologies and tools across asset classes.\\nRisk management\\nKey players in the global financial system are beginning to understand that climate change poses a \\nmaterial risk to financial stability. Physical risks arising from changing climate patterns could result in \\nconsequences such as direct damage from extreme weather events and devaluation of assets in high-\\nrisk locations. Transition risks arising from market or technology developments or policy and legal \\nregulations, such as carbon prices, could vastly and suddenly decrease companies’ profit and value. \\nImportantly, understanding and acting on climate risk is directly linked to aligning with the Paris \\nAgreement. A financial institution that understands where its risks lie in its portfolio can act on that \\ninformation to mitigate these risks by steering financial flows towards low-risk and low-emission \\ninvestments. \\nThe creation of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures (TCFD) made managing climate-related risk a fundamental element of an FI’s climate \\njourney. In its latest report (2020),19 the FSB highlights the progress at the international level to \\nestablish voluntary frameworks for disclosure of climate-related risks and the possible contribution \\nto global financial stability. Support for TCFD’s risk disclosure framework has spread around the \\nworld, with pathways for mandatory disclosure soon entering into force in New Zealand,20 the UK,21 \\nand Hong Kong.22 In Japan, companies of all types have signed up to the TCFD recommendations at \\na faster rate than those in any other country, and Tokyo hosted the first ever TCFD Summit in 2019.23\\nA range of climate-related methods and metrics are available to financial institutions on the topic \\nof transition and physical risks,24 including Moody’s Investors Service, MSCI’s Carbon Delta, Four \\nTwenty Seven, S&P Global/Trucost, Sustainalytics, Oliver Wyman, CLIMAFIN and Ortec Finance. \\nA full overview of current climate-related financial risk assessment methodologies is available in a \\nreport by UNEP-FI, published in April 2021.25\\n16 Institut Lous Bachelier et. al (2020).
